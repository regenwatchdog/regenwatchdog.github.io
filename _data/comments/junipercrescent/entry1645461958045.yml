  They just knocked on my door now (I live on Juniper Crescent) and I didn’t
  answer but they posted a leaflet under my door. They plan on running the
  ballot again in autumn. This passive aggressive intimidation is not helping my
  mental health in the slightest and I know I’m not the only one. Housing
  Officers and workers/staff in general can’t just come knocking on your door
  whenever they feel like it, trying to lure is with winning money in “The Hub”
  and manipulating and being intrusive at every turn. Surely a no is a no and
  not a delayed yes? These practices are sickening!
