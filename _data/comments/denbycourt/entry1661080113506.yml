message: "Dear Mr Mayor \r\nI am a local resident and have lived in the same one bedroom flat in Fitzalan Street, Lambeth for the last 21 years.  I am a senior citizen of nearly 70 years old.  I am writing to beg you not to allow this development project at Denby Court to go ahead for a range of reasons, over and above the ones already put to you in respect of the design, the height of the proposed buildings and the reduced access to light for the local park amenity we all share.\r\n\r\nThe facility for aged and disabled people has been a very important social service to local people and has enabled its residents to remain in the area that they have lived in and loved for many years.  It has also ensured that family and friends could continue frequently to pop in to visit them and participate in their support, providing an extremely important sense of community for the historic area.  The service has been left to run down for years, which demonstrates the meanness and the lack of respect that the council has for the disadvantaged, the old and the vulnerable.  This development proposal will continue to undermine local people at a time after Covid when there has been a resurgence in understanding and commitment to meeting the needs of community and the underprivileged.\r\n\r\nThe high rise development along the river at Nine Elms is providing a minimum of 20,000 flats, and has been in planning and construction for a great many years, however by March 2022 only 5000 of these flats have been sold.  The prices are high as the developers formed their proposals on a booming British economy with full integration in Europe.  Since the political and commercial circumstances have changed and in consequence of greater restrictions on Eastern European investment, estate agents are finding it harder and harder to sell these products.  With a potential recession looming, they are expecting that a great many flats will be mothballed until prospects improve after 10 or 15 years.  This is an appalling outcome and a wastage of resources and subsidies of central government and the local authority. \r\n\r\nThe Lambeth authority needs to be guided by the Mayor to purchase at reduced cost the proposed 40 to 50 flats for council tenants that it wanted to accommodate in Denby Court so that it can meet its statutory requirement for housing.  This is the obvious solution in these economically challenging times.\r\nThis will help ensure that the development of Denby Court becomes a rebuilding and refurbishment of existing buildings at Denby Court and thereby ensures that the needs of the disadvantaged and disabled are met as they were before, in the local area to where they lived and worked all their lives. \r\n\r\nThe building of flats and houses which has gone on around the Lambeth Walk Doorstep Green has been considerable over the past 10 years, also over the period of the pandemic and since the park has become heavily used by local people and their dogs.  Indeed the litter problems and the increased ownership of dogs has been appalling at times.  I overlook the park and watch regularly as dogs are allowed to defecate on the grass and in the bushes regularly, particularly on dark mornings and evenings without being collected when owners believe they are unobserved.  Rubbish is regularly abandoned on the grass and the walkways and this drifts on to the streets.  The state of this food connected rubbish is made worse by the proliferation of crows and foxes that it feeds.  It is appalling to contemplate the additional threat to the park which is likely to be caused by the new proposed development, especially since people living in flats no longer have restrictions on owning dogs.  \r\n\r\nIt is particularly upsetting also to hear that 43 trees are to be cut down to accommodate the proposed development.  The Lambeth Walk area is an inner city site and very barren in parts, and we need has many of the mature trees to be kept as possible.   Landscaped concreted areas around the large buildings proposed do not offer a wealth of green lungs or the attractiveness of the old strong trees.  \r\n\r\nUnderstand, please, that the people objecting to the proposed development are not just middle class ‘nimbies’, we join hands across the social divide to object to the destruction of a unique facility that is much needed to preserve our dignity as a community that cares for all. We expect the council to think differently and not only about themselves or achieving their targets through wanton destruction."
