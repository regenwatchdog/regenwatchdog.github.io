  The proposed development has now been granted planning consent by Lambeth
  Council. Since the development includes high rise towers over 30m (above the
  London Plan threshold) it will need to be reviewed by the Mayor. The
  development has significant impacts on daylight for adjacent homes (outside
  BRE limits), on the adjacent green space (Lambeth Walk Doorstep Green) and
  obscures a heritage view of Parliament's Elizabeth Tower each of which appear
  to conflict with London Plan standards. The local campaign group Save Lambeth
  Walk (savelambethwalk.org ) are recommending call in by the Mayor and by the
  Secretary of State.
