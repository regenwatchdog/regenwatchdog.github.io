  The residents steering group was disbanded in march 2021 by OHG after the so
  called "independent" advisor to the steering group decided to stop working
  with the steering group. The former steering group members suspect that this
  was due to them asking OHG some uncomfortable questions and driving the
  options into a direction that OHG did not want. Surprisingly, the
  "independent" advisor is still working for OHG as independent advisor telling
  everyone on the estate that the deal is good.
