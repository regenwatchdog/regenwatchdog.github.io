  Riverside have consistently let their tenants down, I know because I live
  here, the question on tenancies has been asked time and time again, and not
  been answered properly, we have asked for written assurance on our tenancies
  but we have had nothing I have a secure tenancy (pre 1988) I know and they
  know this type of tenancy does not exist anymore but they continue to lie
  saying "our tenancy will stay the same" when they know this cannot happen,
  they think we are all stupid and cannot see through their lies.  They
  disbanded the residents steering group because of one complaint from one
  resident! And have never formed a new Rsg which is against the GLA's
  proposals. I cannot give you my name for fear of repercussions from Riverside,
  who are using the "divide and conquer" tsctica of late
