message: "Please can I check \"at no point during the consultation, survey or ballot process were residents offered the option of refurbishment of their homes\"?  Option 2 (on page 11 of the \"Future of Tustin Estate\" booklet) is titled \"Refurbishment and Some New Homes\". \r\nThis refurbishment would have been conditional on extra money from some in-fill development, so it wasn't \"only refurbishment and nothing else\".  Is that what you meant?"
