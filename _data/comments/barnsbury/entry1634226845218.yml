  Hi, Newlon are currently establishing a Residents Association on the Barnsbury
  Estate. Early members of this are trying to get clear answers from Newlon
  about the proposed Residents' Charter, which seems to be offering commitments
  to residents (separately to the official offer document on which the ballot
  was held) - although the any part of the Residents' Charter may be subject to
  change by Newlon/developer as the development goes on. It would be the
  Residents' Assoc's responsibility to hold Newlon to account, but by what
  mechanism/recourse to whom is unclear. Is there anyone the Res Assoc can talk
  to who has experience of the practicalities of working with this type of
  redevelopment Charters? Especially redevelopments which are already passed
  planning/have started construction?
