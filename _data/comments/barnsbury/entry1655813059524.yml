message: "Newlon's partner in this redevelopment are Mount Anvil. After just a brief search on the Companies House website they seem to be registered in the chanel islands. \r\n\r\nThis will spirit away profits and benefit only those who have a financial interest in Mount Anvil. All measures will be taken to maximise Mount Anvils' extraction of money from the public sector. This extraction will not even be fully taxed and thus the benefit to the public is diminished.\r\n\r\nThe full value of the public asset - barnsbury estate - will be transferred to the pockets of those that choose to side step the economic benefit that such endeavours should bring to the wider community. \r\n\r\nIt makes me very uneasy to see that Newlon are complicit in this sickening state of affairs whereby residents are manipulated by the threat of continued neglect into voting for something that will promise to deliver for them but will in effect be delivering individuals in the private sector. This partnership between Newlon and Mount Anvil is of questionable property. I can hear the excuses not to deliver on the promises already."
