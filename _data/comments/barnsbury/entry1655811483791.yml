message: "I fear that potentially decent homes built to a reasonable standard will be demolished for homes that are smaller and of inferior construction. Although claims will be made about improved insulation and more efficient heating such claims will ignore the environmental benefits of retrofitting. The environmental benefit of retrofitting is that the embedded carbon in an existing building forms part of the equation. This is carbon that has already been 'spent' and should be included in the environmental impact of the new development.\r\n\r\nThe increased number of units and with a promise of 'community use floor space' and of 'retail and town centre floorspace' feel to be tenuous. Newlon is hiding behind its function as a housing association, disguising the fact that it is a developer. It will prioritise its own objectives over communities and people.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have had a letter and accessed the planning portal on Islington's details are scarce. No plans are yet visible.\r\n\r\nThese look like complicated works that will place a burden of noise and dust on the local community for a number of years. The new buildings will have to be particularly good and (certainly initially) solely available for the occupation by those that have been displaced and who have had to suffer the major building works. Newlon. as a developer who gained this public property for probably something in the region of Â£1 will push to displace social housing tenants for the pursuit of 'market' rents / private lease holders.\r\n\r\nAnd after all this disruption the lack of ability within Newlon to maintain its property will remain.\r\n\r\nLastly other estates in the area run by property developers masked as housing associations (social landlords!) will be looking at this and seeing what they can get away with. And it won't be looking in the sense of 'what can we do for our tenants?' but 'how far can we advance the process of transferring public property to the private sector for gain?' and for the detriment of social housing tenants."
