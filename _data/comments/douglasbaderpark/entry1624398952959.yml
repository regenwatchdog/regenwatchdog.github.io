  We had to move from North Green as we were told this was the 1st phase of the
  development and would need to go into temporary accommodation, which we were
  not prepared to do, also we objected to being offered a flat instead of like
  for like.  We were not prepared to do 2 moves, we are in our sixties and
  although the property we have moved into is very nice it was purely a move for
  piece of mind, had lived in North Green for 38 years and definitely did see a
  major drop in standards under Homegroup
