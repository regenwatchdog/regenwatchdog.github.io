  The homes were not transferred to peabody they belonged to a housing
  association called CBHA who 4 years ago were taken over in what's called a
  extreme takeover against our wishes, our homes are in need of repairs while
  peabody walked off with 170 millions pounds of our money to renew and keep
  there estates, I need as much info as you can provide peabody are the worse
  landlord a tenant could wish for.
