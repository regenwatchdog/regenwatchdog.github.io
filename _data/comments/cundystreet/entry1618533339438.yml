message: "Â·Cundy Quarter (Planning Ref: 20/03308/LBC & 20/03307/FULL): \r\nDespite having more organised opposition (eg The Belgravia Society/ Tenants Assc. etc) compared to Ebury Bridge estate across the road, the WCC Planning Committee agreed that they were minded to grant the application for the Cundy but to defer the final decision (in order for Council officers & Grosvenor to look into the implications of reducing the height of one building, to tackle the loss of light issue to affected homes on Mozart Terrace, Ebury Street). \r\nI understand the Cundy developers has now agreed to reduce the height of the houses along Ebury street from 29 m to 26 m, taking out one floor and setting the topmost floor back. This is what the people in Mozart Terrace had been campaigning for and apparently they consider it a great success.  \r\nAfter securing their right to return to the new estate, Walden House council tenants had already changed sides, to the extend supporting the proposals at the committee meeting!, so no one really cared about the Grosvenor's own tenants or those living in neighbouring properties."
