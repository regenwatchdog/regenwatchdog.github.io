  I am one of many Acton residents deeply concerned about reports that the FPE
  Verdean developers will be applying for planning permission to raise the
  height of the four towers (?) in this development to 37 storeys. Do you know
  what information sources are available about this? Do you have a phone number
  and can I call you to find out more background? My mobile is 07799-384083
