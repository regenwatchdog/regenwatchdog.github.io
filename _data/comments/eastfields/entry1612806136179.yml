  This estate has been neglected both by the Housing association and Merton
  planning.. many home owners should have been denied planning on extending onto
  the balconyâ€™s and converting the garages badly. Also the fact the association
  ripped teak windows out and replaced them with cheap plastic windows. Khan is
  responsible for social cleansing that estate it should have a been upgraded
  not being pulled down
