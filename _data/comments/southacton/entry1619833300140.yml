  Green Man Lane Estate in West Ealing is at the last phase and the Ealing
  Council have broken their promises on right to remain in the area (by
  allocation into A2 Dominion properties) as "the number of new built properties
  in that new estate is unsufficient". Nobody knows if they'll grant the'right
  to return' to existing tenants.
