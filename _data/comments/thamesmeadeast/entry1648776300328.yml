  This is why my parent's rent has been increasing each year for the last two
  years. I really don't know know where they are going to move people to in
  order to accomodate the gentrifiers. A bit fucking jarring considering that
  most of us in this area are poor. People are just getting by. Peabody should
  be disgraced. These are our long time communities and families people are
  ripping apart just to make Thamesmead more "appealing". Why not fucking invest
  that money into US, the actual residents who pay the damn rent every month.
