Circa 300 homes remain under threat of demolition as part of Newham's regeneration of the Custom House area.

A number of council estates were earmarked for redevelopment in Newham's [Custom House & Canning Town regeneration masterplan](https://www.newham.gov.uk/Documents/Environment%20and%20planning/CanningTownCustomHouseAdoptedSPD2008%5B1%5D.pdf), which set out 20 development sites.

The Canning Town side of the scheme is nearing completion but the Custom House estates are yet to be redeveloped. These are marked out on the South-west corner of the masterplan map below.

[This July 2019 update](https://www.newham.gov.uk/Documents/Environment%20and%20planning/CustomHouseRegenerationFAQs.pdf) from Newham confirms that the Council is in the process of rehousing tenants from Area 6 and Area 9 but that Areas 4,5 and 18 will not be decanted in the short term. 

In February 2017, Area 16 (previously designated for enhancement) was [designated](https://www.newham.gov.uk/Documents/Environment%20and%20planning/LPRIssuesOptionPart2.pdf) as an extension to the Area 5 development site.

In 2018, the [PEACH group - Peoples Empowerment Alliance for Custom House]() launched its own [regeneration manifesto](http://www.peach-e16.org.uk/index.php/housing/109-peach-regeneration-manifesto-2018) for the regeneration of the Custom House area:

There is a detailed chapter written about the PEACH group's involvement in the regeneration included in a book [published](https://www.uclpress.co.uk/products/125696) under the title: 'Community-led regeneration, a toolkit for residents and planners'
