Circa 30 council homes are earmarked for redevelopment at Reynardson Court in Tottenham. 

They have been identified for redevelopment in Haringey's [Tottenham Area Action Plan](https://www.haringey.gov.uk/sites/haringeygovuk/files/final_haringey_tottenham_aap_dtp_online.pdf) (site SS3).

In March 2021, Haringey [commissioned](https://www.minutes.haringey.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?ID=2559) architects to draw up plans for the site.
