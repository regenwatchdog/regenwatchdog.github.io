1027 Council homes on Haringey's Northumberland Park estates have been earmarked for redevelopment in Tottenham.

They have been identified for redevelopment in Haringey's [Tottenham Area Action Plan](https://www.haringey.gov.uk/sites/haringeygovuk/files/final_haringey_tottenham_aap_dtp_online.pdf) (site NT4).
