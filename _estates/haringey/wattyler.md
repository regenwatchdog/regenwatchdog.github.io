Circa 100 homes have been earmarked for potential demolition at Wat Tyler House on Haringey's Campbourne estate.

In July 2019, Haringey's Cabinet committee [approved](https://www.minutes.haringey.gov.uk/documents/s110214/Council%20housing%20delivery%20programme%20Cabinet%20report%20v7.2%20_18.15.pdf) the inclusion of Wat Tyler House in its Housing Development Programme.
