The Hillcrest estate in Highgate has been earmarked for redevelopment in Haringey's [Estate Renewal Strategy](https://www.minutes.haringey.gov.uk/documents/s48324/Housing%20Investment%20and%20Estate%20Renewal%20Strategy%20-%20whole%20report%20-%20Paul%20Munday.pdf) and the Council's [Local Plan site allocations DPD](https://www.haringey.gov.uk/sites/haringeygovuk/files/final_haringey_site_allocations_dtp_online.pdf) (site SA44).

Haringey Council undertook a [capacity study](https://www.haringey.gov.uk/sites/haringeygovuk/files/hillcrest_report_03042013_final.pdf) which examined several options for the estate including refurbishment, infill development and full redevelopment. 

Informaton on Haringey's [website](https://www.haringey.gov.uk/housing/housing-consultations/hillcrest-estate) indicates that an infill option is being progressed but the estate remains designated in the Local Plan.
