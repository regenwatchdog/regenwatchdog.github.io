285 homes are under threat of demolition on Havering's Waterloo road and Queen's street estate in Romford.

The estate is situated between Romford Town Centre and the site of the new Crossrail station.

It has been earmarked for redevelopment as part of Havering's [£1bn joint venture with developer Wates Residential](https://www.wates.co.uk/articles/case-study/borough-of-havering-housing-redevelopment/) which will see 12 of the borough's estates redeveloped.

In June 2020, Havering [submitted plans](https://www.pbctoday.co.uk/news/planning-construction-news/waterloo-estate-regeneration/77408/) for the redevelopment of the estate. The detailed application documents are not yet publicly available but Havering Council says the plans are for for 1,380 new homes of which 550 will be “affordable” and a 'number' of which for “low-cost home ownership”.

The scheme is being [funded](/approved/funding) by the Mayor and has been exempted from his [requirement](/approved/ballotexemptions) to ballot residents on the demolition of their homes.

Havering's [re-housing offer](https://www.havering.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/1877/information_for_property_owners.pdf) for leaseholders displaced by their schemes is by far one of the poorest in comparison with other London boroughs.

It makes no provision for the gap between the value leaesholders receive for their current homes and the cost of the replacement new-builds. It simply gives them 'first refusal' on the purchase of a new home - if they can afford it!
