129 homes are under threat of demolition at Stangate & Canterbury House in Lambeth.

Stangate House, a fourteen storey block containing 52 flats and, Canterbury House, a nine storey block containing 77 units were initially earmarked for demolition in 2001. 

The buildings are owned by the Guy's and St Thomas' Charity. Whilst the charity is independent of the NHS Trust, it is understood that Stangate and Canterbury Houses were originally intended to house key workers from the adjacent hospital. Council briefing papers confirm that a number of the homes are still occupied on protected tenancies. The remainder [appear to be](https://www.zoopla.co.uk/to-rent/property/london/royal-street/) let out at market rent as private accommodation.   

Plans to redevelop the land north and south of Royal Street, close to St Thomas' Hospital, have been on the agenda since at least 2003.

Lambeth Council originally rejected the Terry Farrell-designed proposals for Founder's Place in 2006 but after a public inquiry the scheme was eventually approved in 2007 by the then communities secretary Hazel Blears.

The scheme was designed by Farrells to provide a range of affordable and private housing and health facilities (including key worker accommodation and accommodation for families of sick children being treated at the Evelina Children's Hospital).

In 2010, the charity [decided](https://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/4620) not to proceed with the development in its then present form.

In 2019, it was [reported](https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/ahmm-lands-major-scheme-next-to-st-thomas-hospital) that the charity was working with developer Stanhope on a redesigned scheme in a joint venture with US hedge fund Baupost Group.
