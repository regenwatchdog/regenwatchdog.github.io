306 homes are earmarked for demolition on Lambeth's Cressingham Gardens estate at Brockwell Park.

In 2016, Lambeth Council [took the decision](https://moderngov.lambeth.gov.uk/documents/s80093/Cabinet%20Report%20-%20March%202016%20v8.pdf) to demolish the estate based on fact that refurbishment estimates were Â£14,000 higher per dwelling than the rest of its estates and this represents 'poor value for money':

Lambeth also claims that the redevelopment of the estate will result in the provision of more 'affordable' housing to address the housing crisis. It plans to reprovide the existing council homes and provide an extra 27 at council rent plus a further 48 at 'no higher than LHA rates':

[LHA rates for Lambeth](https://lha-direct.voa.gov.uk/SearchResults.aspx?LocalAuthorityId=22&LHACategory=999&Month=6&Year=2020&SearchPageParameters=true) are currently as follows:

The estate is one of [four estates](/underthreat/lambeth/) earmarked for demolition in Lambeth's estate renewal programme.

The estate was initially awarded grant funding by the Mayor and exempted from his requirement to ballot residents. In September 2020, the Mayor announced that funding had been [withdrawn from the scheme](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/news/gla-funding-withdrawn-for-three-major-council-estate-regeneration-schemes-68045), but Lambeth vowed to proceed with demolition regardless using its own funds.

There is an active [campaign group](https://savecressingham.wordpress.com) created by residents on the estate. In 2016 they launched ['Cressingham People's Plan - http://cressinghampeoplesplan.org.uk/](http://cressinghampeoplesplan.org.uk/) which offers a viable alternative to demolition.

In July 2019, they [had their application approved](http://www.brixtonbuzz.com/2019/07/cressingham-gardens-residents-win-right-to-transfer/) for the Right To Transfer (RTT) ownership of the estate into a community-owned company outside of council control.

Lambeth's [shared equity](https://moderngov.lambeth.gov.uk/documents/s87368/Appendix%20A2%20-%20HOMEOWNERS%20v5%20B.pdf) offer for leaseholders requires a minimum 60% equity, which may result in them having to invest personal savings or take out mortgages. This was [deemed unlawful](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/16/government-blocks-controversial-plan-to-force-out-housing-estate-residents) by the Secretary of State at the 2015 Aylesbury estate CPO inquiry and required Southwark to [amend its policy](http://moderngov.southwarksites.com/documents/s74901/Report%20Amending%20the%20shared%20equity%20rehousing%20policy%20for%20qualifying%20homeowners%20affected%20by%20regenerati.pdf) and reduce the requirement from 50% to 25%.

In November 2020, Lambeth (or rather its [SPV - 'Homes for Lambeth'](https://www.homesforlambeth.co.uk/)) applied for permission to demolish 12 family homes in two maisonette blocks on the South-east corner of the [Cressingham Gardens estate](https://estatewatch.london/estates/lambeth/cressingham/).

The [planning statement](https://planning.lambeth.gov.uk/online-applications/files/83BAE4274987382EE947282499316D28/pdf/20_02406_RG3-REVISED_PLANNING_STATEMENT-2579279.pdf) (prepared by Savills) explains that 20 new homes will be built of which 14 will be 'Council level' rent and the remaining 6 shared ownership.

Supporting documents for the planning application and details of how to submit objections are available on Lambeth's planning portal [here - ref:(20/02406/RG3)](https://planning.lambeth.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=QDRW4MBOGMR00).
