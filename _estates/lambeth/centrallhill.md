476 homes are earmarked for demolition on Lambeth's Central Hill estate.

Central Hill is the largest of Lambeth's [five estates](/underthreat/lambeth) earmarked for demolition.

It was first earmarked for potential redevelopment in a [December 2014 Cabinet decision](https://moderngov.lambeth.gov.uk/documents/s70441/03_Lambeth%20Estate%20Regeneration%20and%20Housing%20Delivery%20-%20December%202014%20v3%20docx.pdf).

Lambeth [says](https://moderngov.lambeth.gov.uk/documents/s87425/Cabinet%20Report%20-%20Central%20Hill%20-%20March%202017%20-%20final%20clean%204%20RD.pdf) that it is demolishing the estate because the cost of refurbishing the existing homes is £44,000 per dwelling when its average cost for other estates is only £16,000 and that the Council simply doesn't have the £18.5m required.

In 2019, an [FOI request revealed](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/581698/response/1393236/attach/3/Attachment.pdf) that Lambeth is estimated to be spending £94m alone on buying back leasehold properties across its 5 estate demolitions.  

Whilst the decant and re-housing programme started in 2016, the estate remains fully occupied with [void units being let out at full market rents or as temporary accommodation at LHA rates](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/581698/response/1393236/attach/4/Attachment%202.pdf).

The estate is not one of those listed as having agreed [grant funding](/approved/funding) from the mayor or that has been [exempted](/approved/ballotexemptions) from his requirement to ballot residents on the demolition of their homes.

In November 2020, Lambeth approved a 'kick-start' initial phase of redevelopment involving a decanted block previously used for temporary housing. Campaigners have now set up camp at the foot of the empty block as it is being prepared for demolition.
