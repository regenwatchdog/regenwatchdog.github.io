431 homes are earmarked for demolition on Lambeth's Fenwick estate in Clapham.

Fenwick is one of the largest of Lambeth's [five estates](/underthreat/lambeth) earmarked for demolition.

It was first earmarked for potential redevelopment in a [December 2014 Cabinet decision](https://moderngov.lambeth.gov.uk/documents/s70441/03_Lambeth%20Estate%20Regeneration%20and%20Housing%20Delivery%20-%20December%202014%20v3%20docx.pdf).

Lambeth [says](https://moderngov.lambeth.gov.uk/documents/g9750/Publicreports%20pack%20Monday%2011-Jul-2016%2019.00%20Cabinet.pdf?T=10) that it is demolishing the estate because the cost of refurbishing the existing homes is £14,000 per dwelling higher than the average for its other estates and that the £9m overall cost of refurbishment is poor value for money:

The scheme was stalled in 2018, when the Council was [forced](https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/karakusevic-carson-forces-council-to-rerun-flawed-estate-contest/10028456.article) to re-run its procurement process because of a conflict of interests.

The Mayor agreed [funding](/approved/funding) for the scheme in 2017, but Lambeth hasn't yet applied to an [exemption](/approved/ballotexemptions) from the Mayor's requirement to ballot residents on the demolition of their homes.

Whilst the decant and re-housing programme started in 2016, the estate remains fully occupied with [void units being let out at full market rents or as temporary accommodation at LHA rates](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/581698/response/1393236/attach/4/Attachment%202.pdf).

In November 2020, Lambeth approved a 'kick-start' phase involving the redevelopment of a small, decanted former supported housing block on the corner of the estate. You can read more about the application on Lambeth's planning portal [here](https://moderngov.lambeth.gov.uk/documents/s122755/PAC%20-%20Fenwick%2020-02374-RG3%20FINAL.pdf).
