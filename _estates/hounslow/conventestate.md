440 homes are earmarked for demolition on Hounslow's Convent Way estate.

In January 2020, Hounslow's Cabinet [agreed a comprehensive review](https://democraticservices.hounslow.gov.uk/documents/s157644/CEX432%20Housing%20Estate%20Regeneration%20Programme.pdf) of its 171 council estates with a view to infill or redevelopment.

In the [Cabinet report](https://democraticservices.hounslow.gov.uk/documents/s157644/CEX432%20Housing%20Estate%20Regeneration%20Programme.pdf) it was agreed that six estates had already been identified as 'poor performing estates'. 

The six estates are: the Brabazon estate; the Brookwood estate; Charlton House; the Convent Way estate; the Norman Crescent estate and the Oriel estate.

The Convent Way estate was identified as the most likely of these 'poor performing estates' that would benefit from early regeneration.

The estate was originally built in 1967. It comprises of one 12 storytower block, 16 medium rise (3 to 5 storey) blocks. In total the estate comprises 440 homes. In addition, the estate contains a health centre, community centre, and a small shopping parade.

The Council suggests that the redeveloped estate could comprise up to a possible 1100 new homes, a community centre, play areas and improved public transport links.

The Council's [2020 Cabinet report](https://democraticservices.hounslow.gov.uk/documents/s157644/CEX432%20Housing%20Estate%20Regeneration%20Programme.pdf) explains that the estate was chosen after an audit showed it faced increasing bills for maintenance as well as concerns over nuisance behaviour like fly-tipping.

It was also deemed unlikely the estate would be able to meet the councilâ€™s energy efficiency targets.

In April 2021, Hounslow started [consulting](https://haveyoursay.hounslow.gov.uk/housing/conventfeedback/) on its rehousing offer to residents ahead of an expected ballot later in the year.
