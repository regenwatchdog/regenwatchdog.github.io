Planning permission was originally granted in 2012, but a revised application was approved in September 2018, which enabled the construction of 599 new homes of which 315 affordable (236 social rent, 7 affordable rent and 72 intermediate).

The final phase 3 of the scheme will provide 217 homes for private sale and 31 homes for shared ownership.
