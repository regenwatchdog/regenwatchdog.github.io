171 homes on Enfield's New Avenue estate have been approved for demolition with just 60 replacement properties at 'social rent'.

Enfield Council signed a joint-venture agreement with developer Countryside Properties for the redevelopment of the estate in 2015.

Phase one of the three phase scheme has been demolished and is nearing completion. Remaining phases are still occupied but in the process of beeing 'decanted'.

The estate is being replaced by 408 new homes of which only 34% will be 'affordable' despite the Mayor's policy requirement of 50% in estate regeneration schemes.

In December 2017 Enfield [set out its intention](/images/newavenuesr.pdf) to provide just 60 social rented replacement units, the remainder of the 'affordable housing' being for affordable rent (up to 80% market rent) or intermediate affordable.

The section 106 agreement is not publicly available on Enfield's planning portal so it is not clear whether these 60 social rented homes have been secured as such or in perpetuity.

The scheme is being [funded](/approval/funding) by the Mayor and has been exempted from his [ballot requirements](/approved/ballotrequirements).

Countryside have started [marketing](https://www.countrysideproperties.com/all-developments/london/new-avenue) new phase 1 homes off-plan on the redeveloped estate for prices starting at £600k.

There is no provision on the redeveloped estate for the estate's 40 leaseholders. Enfield has no shared equity scheme - if leaseholders want to buy one of the new shared ownership homes they will have to qualify for eligibility and pay rent on the unowned equity.
