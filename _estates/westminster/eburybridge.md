Demolition is well underway of the 336 homes earmarked for demolition on Westminster's Ebury Bridge estate in Pimlico. Westminster has taken the [controversial decision](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/news/westminster-city-council-accused-of-trying-to-dodge-scrutiny-over-estate-regeneration-63267) of decanting and demolishing the estate without first seeking planning permission or balloting residents.

Westminster Council's intention to regenerate the estate started in 2010, when the estate was first identified in the Council's Housing Renewal Strategy as one of five key estates within the borough in need of significant investment.

Plans were submitted in 2014 [(ref:14/01295/COFUL)](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/public%3A//public%3A//PAWS/media_id_255164///ebury_bridge_estate_report.pdf) which were subsequently approved in 2016. These proposals were found to be unviable and remained unimplemented until they subsequently expired in 2019.

The 2014 plans envisaged the retention of four of the estates grey brick blocks.A fresh planning application was submitted in July 2020 which now includes the retention of just one of these blocks.

In May 2021, Westminster Council approved its own planning application for the redevelopment of the estate.

The estate comprising 336 homes (198 social rent/138 leasehold) will now be replaced by 781 homes of which 239 social rent - an uplift of just 41 social rented units despite more than doubling the density.

The estate is being redeveloped by the Council itself. Figures in the planning application [supporting documents](https://idoxpa.westminster.gov.uk/online-applications/files/33305033EC2B493EF178E8AB19BB85FF/pdf/20_04366_COOUT-FINANCIAL_VIABILITY_ASSESSMENT_REV01-6774119.pdf) show that Westminster Council is spending a staggering £108m on decanting and demolishing the estate and that despite the replacement social housing being partly cross-subsidised by the new private homes, it is estimated that Westminster will have to fork out a further £90m during the course of the estate's redevelopment.

The planning application is yet to be signed off by the Mayor, so it is open to him to call them in and decide on the applications himself.

Given the significant public subsidy involved, the housing crisis and the Mayor's recent [declaration](https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/mayor-declares-a-retrofit-revolution) of a *"‘retrofit revolution’ to tackle the climate emergency"* one might expect the Mayor to exercise his call-in powers to explore whether £198m of public money might be better spent on the [environmental, economic and social benefits](https://www.estatewatch.london/refurbishment/) of refurbishment.
