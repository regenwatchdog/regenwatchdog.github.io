358 homes on three estates in Westminster's Church Street Area are under threat of demolition.

Church street Area is located in Maida Vale, situated beside the Regent's Canal and in close proximity of Regent's Park.
It was [designated](https://lbhf.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=7cab3cdf6e344a0fb24df59ed6b9bdc5) as being situated within a __Housing Renewal__ zone in Westminster's [draft 2019-2040 Local Plan](https://www.westminster.gov.uk/cityplan2040).

It is also within the boundary of the __Edgeware Road Housing Zone__, one of [30 special housing zones](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/housing-and-land/increasing-housing-supply/housing-zones#acc-i-42741) designated by the Mayor to deliver accelerated housing development. The Edgeware Road zone is expected to deliver 1700 new homes of which this site will provide 1167. 

The 358 homes under threat are located in what has been labelled sites A, B and C:

In February 2021, Westminster Council came under fire after it was [reported](https://londonnewsonline.co.uk/residents-petrified-that-housing-development-could-destroy-businesses/) that retailers had been served with notices to quit in the next phase of the Council's redevelopment of the [Church Street area estates](https://estatewatch.london/estates/westminster/churchstreet/).

In Spring 2021, Westminster Council started its initial pre-application consultation ahead of its planned submission of a planning application in Autumn 2021. The pre-planning consultation booklet can be found [here](https://churchstreet.org/assets/Documents/140_55-WCC-Church-Street-ABC-consultation-stage-2_Booklet_web_AW2.pdf).

While there have been [surveys](https://churchstreet.org/assets/Documents/Church-St-Consultation-Report.pdf) carried out test opinion, there hasn't been a formal ballot of residents on the demolition of their homes. This means that Westminster won't be able to apply for grant funding from the Mayor's Affordable Housing Programme.
