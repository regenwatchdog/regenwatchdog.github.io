Circa 500 homes are under threat of demolition at the Hall Place estate in Maida Vale.

The estate is situated off the Edgware road near the Regent's Canal. It sits [within](https://lbhf.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=7cab3cdf6e344a0fb24df59ed6b9bdc5) an area that has been designated a __Housing Renewal__ zone in Westminster's [draft 2019-2040 Local Plan](https://www.westminster.gov.uk/cityplan2040).

It is also within the boundary of the __Edgeware Road Housing Zone__, one of [30 special housing zones](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/housing-and-land/increasing-housing-supply/housing-zones#acc-i-42741) designated by the Mayor to deliver accelerated housing development. The Edgeware Road zone is expected to deliver 1700 new homes.

The estate has already been subject to a small amount of in-fill development, with [60 homes delivered](https://www.westminster.gov.uk/parsons-north-development) on open space at the foot of Parsons House.
