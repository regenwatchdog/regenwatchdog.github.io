Circa 150 homes are under threat of potential demolition on Westminster' Lilestone estate.

The Lilestone estate is a small estate in Maida Vale, situated beside the Regent's Canal and in close proximity of Regent's Park.
It is also [located](https://lbhf.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=7cab3cdf6e344a0fb24df59ed6b9bdc5) within an area that has been designated a __Housing Renewal__ zone in Westminster's [draft 2019-2040 Local Plan](https://www.westminster.gov.uk/cityplan2040).

It is also within the boundary of the __Edgeware Road Housing Zone__, one of [30 special housing zones](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/housing-and-land/increasing-housing-supply/housing-zones#acc-i-42741) designated by the Mayor to deliver accelerated housing development. The Edgeware Road zone is expected to deliver 1700 new homes.

The redevelopment of the estate has not been specifically included in the [current masterplan](https://committees.westminster.gov.uk/documents/s24437/Church_Street_masterplan__boards.pdf) but this does envisage bringing such further sites forward within the next 15-20 years.
