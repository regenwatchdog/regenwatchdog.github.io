Circa 2,000 homes remain earmarked for demolition on the remaining 3 phases of Southwark's Aylesbury estate redevelopment.

Two early 'demonstration' phases were completed in 2014 on the corner of the estate. Demolition of the first main phase was completed in June 2020 and is now under construction.

Phase 2 (of 4 phases in total) is approximately two years behind schedule and there is still no planning application submitted. 

The original estate was completed in 1977, providing 2,758 homes. In 1999 the Aylesbury estate received £56m as part of Labour’s New Deal for Communities (NDC) programme. 
The NDC finished in 2010 and the  Aylesbury Area Action Plan (AAAP) was formally adopted. The AAAP outlined the estate’s regeneration, involving phased demolition of all existing buildings and new-build re-development, increasing density to 3,575 homes. The first new homes were completed in 2012 and the Council appointed Notting Hill Genesis Housing Association as its development partner. The further works will happen in four phases, leading to an incremental decant and demolition of the estate, with the overall regeneration estimated to be completed in 2036.

Notting Hill Genesis' [planning application](http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!clWxEC35adJ29O7pMe62Bg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d) describes the replacement 'social housing' as a mix of 'target and affordable rent' and acknowledges that in any event there will be an overall net loss of 931 social rented homes.

In February 2015 a group of protesters [occupied](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/18/six-arrested-as-police-help-in-evictions-from-london-estate) the first development site in protest at the loss of council homes and residents [disenfranchised](/images/SNWolverton.pdf) by the scheme.

In September 2016, after a [protracted public inquiry](http://35percent.org/2016-09-18-aylesbury-compulsory-purchase-order-rejected/) the Secretary of State [rejected](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/16/government-blocks-controversial-plan-to-force-out-housing-estate-residents) Southwark Council's application to remove remaining leaseholders with a compulsory purchase order on the grounds that rehousing offers to leaseholders wouldn't enable them to stay in the area. This subsequently led to a [policy change](/images/SN19April2018.pdf) which improved the rehousing offer.

In July 2020, Southwark resolved to step in and [stump up £193m](http://35percent.org/2020-07-12-aylesbury-estate-fds-variation/) to help its development partner complete the first phase of the Aylesbury estate redevelopment, in what has been [termed as a bail out](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/housing-chief-denies-aylesbury-estate-deal-is-bail-out-for-notting-hill-genesis/) after its development partner was forced scale back its operations by the Social Housing Regulator.

The Aylesbury estate features as one of the [case studies](/casestudies/aylesbury) in the research section of this website, which provides more detailed information about the regeneration.
