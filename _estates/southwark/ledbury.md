224 homes have been earmarked for demolition on Southwark's Ledbury estate off the Old Kent Road.

The estate was identified as suffering from fire safety issues following the Grenfell disaster.

In April 2021, Southwark Council balloted residents on whether their homes should be demolished or remediation works commissioned. 56% of eligible residents took part and 86% of these voted for demolition.
