16 homes at Reginald House in Deptford have been earmarked for demolition as part of Lewisham's [regeneration of Deptford](https://lewisham.gov.uk/tidemill). 

Lewisham signed a joint venture agreement with housing association Peabody for redevelopment of the homes and the adjacent Tidemill Gardens park in 2015. The Tidemill redevelopment will provide 209 homes of which just 13 will be provided as social rent for returning residents, 104 will be London Affordable Rent, 38 will be for shared ownership and 51 will be for private sale.
