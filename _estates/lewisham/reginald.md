16 homes at Reginald House in Deptford have been earmarked for demolition as part of Lewisham's [regeneration of Deptford](https://lewisham.gov.uk/tidemill). 

Lewisham signed a joint venture agreement with housing association Family Mosaic (now Peabody) for redevelopment of the homes and the adjacent Tidemill Gardens and former Deptford Green school site in 2015.

Planning permission was granted in 2018 to provide 329 new homes (120 on the Deptford Green school site and 209 on the Reginald House site)of which just 14 social rent (Amersham site) and 74 London Affordable Rent (Reginald Hse site). The remainder will be a mix of private and shared ownership housing. 

Peabody submitted a financial viability assessment claiming that it couldn't provide any more social or affordable housing or the scheme would be unviable.

Despite the Mayor's requirement for financial viability assessments to be made public, Lewisham Council has not published the viability assessment on its planning portal.
