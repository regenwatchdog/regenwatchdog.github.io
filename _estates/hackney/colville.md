Circa 200 homes remain earmarked for demolition on Hackney's Colville estate.

The estate is situated between the Regents canal to the North and Shoreditch Park to the South. It originally comprised 432 homes around half of which have now been demolished.

Phases 1, 2 and 3 of the scheme are complete and the decant has now started on phase 4 of the 7-phase scheme.

The scheme 925 dwellings. Of these, 476 will be for market sale, 111 for shared ownership or shared equity, and 338 for social rent.

The scheme is being [funded](/approved/funding) by the Mayor and [exempted](/approved/ballotexemptions) from his requirement to ballot residents on the demolition of their homes.

In August 2019, it was [reported](https://www.hackneygazette.co.uk/news/bridport-house-tenants-told-hoxton-block-could-be-demolished-rather-than-repaired-1-6243329) that one of the first buildings completed in the regeneration may be demolished because of structural defects.

Hackney Council subsequently decided on remediation works which are estimated to cost Â£6m. In January 2022, it was [reported](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/news/london-council-warns-all-options-remain-open-to-recoup-costs-on-defect-ridden-block-as-repairs-start-73949) that the Council is considering legal action to recover the cost of these works.
