Circa 1,000 homes on Hackney's Woodberry Down estate near Finsbury Park remain under threat of demolition.

Circa 900 homes have already been demolished in the first two phases. Phase 3 of the scheme was granted planning permission in Summer 2019. The scheme proposes to build 5,500 new homes in total over eight phases of development by 2029, 41% of which will be 'affordable'.

The estate has been sold by Hackney Council in a phased conditional agreement to a joint venture between developer Berkeley Homes and Notting Hill Genesis housing association (cf. Aylesbury estate). 

In August 2019, it was [reported](https://www.hackneycitizen.co.uk/2019/08/20/handful-leaseholders-council-plans-woodberry-down-redevelopment/) that _"42 per cent of the homes for private sale in the scheme have gone to overseas buyers, with a predicted net loss by the Town Hall of just over 300 social rented homes."_ and that _"Notting Hill Genesis have been actively seeking to prevent leaseholders taking up shared equity properties in favour of shared ownerships which would yield rental income"_.

The scheme is being [funded](/approved/funding) by the Mayor and [exempted](/approved/ballotexemptions) from his requirement to ballot residents on the demolition of their homes.

The first 'kick-start' phase one of the scheme was [approved in 2008](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/planning-applications-and-decisions/planning-application-search/woodberry-down-estate-kick-start-site-one-0) and completed in 2012.

The outline planning application for the remaining phases of the scheme was approved in 2014. The [section 106 agreement](/images/woodberrys106.pdf) for the outline scheme secures 36% affordable housing in phase 2, 41% in phases 3,4 and 5; and 43% in phases 6, 7 and 8.

36% of the affordable housing in phase 2 is secured as social rent and 47% in phases 3,4 and 5 but the tenure split in the last three phases will determined by a viability assessment to be submitted by Berkeley when those phases are progressed.
