Circa 100 homes are earmarked for demolition on Hackney's New Era estate in Hoxton by housing association Dolphin Living.

The estate is situated adjacent to the [Colville estate](/estates/hackney/colville) which is also undergoing redevelopment.

New Era was at the heart of protests supported by Russell Brand back in 2014 after its owners threatened rent hikes which could have led to the break up of the estate's tight-knit community.

The proposed redevelopment will double the density with 199 new residential units and 344sqm of retail floorspace provided across buildings ranging from three to 14 storeys.

The plans approved by Hackney Council in July 2020 supposedly enable the current 78 tenants to be able to return to a flat of equivalent size in a redeveloped New Era, with the same number of bedrooms, at a rent level no higher than if the estate had not been developed.

But the Mayor's [report](https://gla.force.com/pr/s/planning-application/a0i4J0000003T7vQAE/20194944s1?tabset-c2f3b=2) subsequently published in August 2020, says the proposals would result in rent levels more than twice as high as current rents enjoyed by tenants:

The planning application is now sitting with the Mayor. As of January 2021 there has been no final stage 2 report published on the GLA's planning portal.
