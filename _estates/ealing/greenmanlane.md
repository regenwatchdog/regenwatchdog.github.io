464 homes on Ealing's Green Man Lane estate are earmarked for demolition.

The Green Man Lane estate regeneration is a joint venture between Ealing Council, developer Rydon and A2Dominion housing association involving the phased demolition of the estate's 464 homes in four phases over 10 years.

Ealing Council [describes](https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201104/housing_regeneration/373/green_man_lane/2) the replacement social housing as 'affordable rent' tenure, which can mean anything up to 80% market rent.

In December 2016, Ealing [granted planning permission](https://pam.ealing.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&keyVal=ODI3M8JM09L00) for phase 3 of the regeneration. There are no publicly available section 106 agreements for the scheme so it is not possible to confirm the precise tenure of the replacement 'affordable' housing.

Phase 4 of the scheme appears to have been stalled - there are no planning applications, demolition notices or other information relating to phse 4 available online.

There is no information relating to a right to return for tenants or leaseholders. In any event, Ealing's [shared equity offer to leaseholders](https://ealing.cmis.uk.com/ealing/Document.ashx?czJKcaeAi5tUFL1DTL2UE4zNRBcoShgo=orv9zlc1hcwmefvl%2FzC77iPz0uNaQowGhPWmce8m8fB%2FMzqMI5BQBA%3D%3D&rUzwRPf%2BZ3zd4E7Ikn8Lyw%3D%3D=pwRE6AGJFLDNlh225F5QMaQWCtPHwdhUfCZ%2FLUQzgA2uL5jNRG4jdQ%3D%3D&mCTIbCubSFfXsDGW9IXnlg%3D%3D=hFflUdN3100%3D&kCx1AnS9%2FpWZQ40DXFvdEw%3D%3D=hFflUdN3100%3D&uJovDxwdjMPoYv%2BAJvYtyA%3D%3D=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&FgPlIEJYlotS%2BYGoBi5olA%3D%3D=NHdURQburHA%3D&d9Qjj0ag1Pd993jsyOJqFvmyB7X0CSQK=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&WGewmoAfeNR9xqBux0r1Q8Za60lavYmz=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&WGewmoAfeNQ16B2MHuCpMRKZMwaG1PaO=ctNJFf55vVA%3D) requires them to invest their personal savings and take out a mortgage if they want to take up the offer. This was [deemed unlawful](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/16/government-blocks-controversial-plan-to-force-out-housing-estate-residents) by the Secretary of State at the 2015 Aylesbury estate CPO inquiry and required Southwark to [amend](http://moderngov.southwarksites.com/documents/s74901/Report%20Amending%20the%20shared%20equity%20rehousing%20policy%20for%20qualifying%20homeowners%20affected%20by%20regenerati.pdf) its policy.
