Circa 500 homes on the Golf Links estate in Ealing are under threat of demolition.

The regeneration of the Golf Links estate in Ealing was originally supposed to involve the redevelopment of just four low-rise blocks in 3 phases - (Phase 1 - Dormers Rise, Phase 2 - Peterhead Court, phase 3 - Alnmouth & Portrush blocks). 

In October 2018, Ealing Council [resolved](https://ealing.cmis.uk.com/ealing/Document.ashx?czJKcaeAi5tUFL1DTL2UE4zNRBcoShgo=T29KJkkv6%2B%2FEOf%2F4pv0XwtQAUSiI7enW%2FlmOaGncZVyUQOQgHSXqXw%3D%3D&rUzwRPf%2BZ3zd4E7Ikn8Lyw%3D%3D=pwRE6AGJFLDNlh225F5QMaQWCtPHwdhUfCZ%2FLUQzgA2uL5jNRG4jdQ%3D%3D&mCTIbCubSFfXsDGW9IXnlg%3D%3D=hFflUdN3100%3D&kCx1AnS9%2FpWZQ40DXFvdEw%3D%3D=hFflUdN3100%3D&uJovDxwdjMPoYv%2BAJvYtyA%3D%3D=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&FgPlIEJYlotS%2BYGoBi5olA%3D%3D=NHdURQburHA%3D&d9Qjj0ag1Pd993jsyOJqFvmyB7X0CSQK=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&WGewmoAfeNR9xqBux0r1Q8Za60lavYmz=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&WGewmoAfeNQ16B2MHuCpMRKZMwaG1PaO=ctNJFf55vVA%3D) to extend the regeneration involving the further demolition of circa 100 homes in a fourth phase.

Whilst phase 3 has received in-principle agreement for grant funding from the Mayor, it is exempt from the Mayor's requirement to ballot residents because there are less than 150 homes proposed for demolition.

Ealing Council recently [announced](https://www.ealing.gov.uk/info/201104/housing_regeneration/372/golf_links_estate/2) that it is looking at options for the further redevelopment of the estate beyond phase 4:

Ealing says that tenants will have a right to return to new homes on the redeveloped phases, but its [shared equity offer to leaseholders](https://ealing.cmis.uk.com/ealing/Document.ashx?czJKcaeAi5tUFL1DTL2UE4zNRBcoShgo=orv9zlc1hcwmefvl%2FzC77iPz0uNaQowGhPWmce8m8fB%2FMzqMI5BQBA%3D%3D&rUzwRPf%2BZ3zd4E7Ikn8Lyw%3D%3D=pwRE6AGJFLDNlh225F5QMaQWCtPHwdhUfCZ%2FLUQzgA2uL5jNRG4jdQ%3D%3D&mCTIbCubSFfXsDGW9IXnlg%3D%3D=hFflUdN3100%3D&kCx1AnS9%2FpWZQ40DXFvdEw%3D%3D=hFflUdN3100%3D&uJovDxwdjMPoYv%2BAJvYtyA%3D%3D=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&FgPlIEJYlotS%2BYGoBi5olA%3D%3D=NHdURQburHA%3D&d9Qjj0ag1Pd993jsyOJqFvmyB7X0CSQK=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&WGewmoAfeNR9xqBux0r1Q8Za60lavYmz=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&WGewmoAfeNQ16B2MHuCpMRKZMwaG1PaO=ctNJFf55vVA%3D) requires them to invest their personal savings and take out a mortgage if they want to take up the offer. This was [deemed unlawful](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/16/government-blocks-controversial-plan-to-force-out-housing-estate-residents) by the Secretary of State at the 2015 Aylesbury estate CPO inquiry and required Southwark to [amend](http://moderngov.southwarksites.com/documents/s74901/Report%20Amending%20the%20shared%20equity%20rehousing%20policy%20for%20qualifying%20homeowners%20affected%20by%20regenerati.pdf) its policy.
