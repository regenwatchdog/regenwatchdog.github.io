Circa 100 homes on Stepney's Clichy estate have been [earmarked for demolition earmarked for redevelopment](https://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/lgnl/council_and_democracy/consultations/Housing-consultations/HAP_Houses.aspx) by Tower Hamlets Council.

In April 2020, the ballot of 'eligible' residents on Stepney's [Clichy estate](https://estatewatch.github.io/estates/towerhamlets/clichyestate/) went ahead despite [consultation sessions being cancelled due to the Coronavirus](https://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/lgnl/council_and_democracy/consultations/Housing-consultations/HAP_Houses.aspx) and resulted in a 98% vote in favour of redevelopment on a [90% turnout](https://www.housingtoday.co.uk/news/tower-hamlets-estate-regeneration-plan-wins-resident-approval/5105879.article).

Residents had previously been consulted on an 'infill' option as well as full redevelopment. But the [info pack](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/clichy_estate_ballot_paper_accom?nocache=incoming-1565802#incoming-1565802) sent to residents with the ballot papers asked only whether they wanted full redevelopment or not. Leaseholders were [told](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/658746/response/1565802/attach/4/Ballot%20information%20requested%201.pdf) if they voted against redevelopment then they would be faced with major bills. Residents were told that if they don't vote for full redevelopment then they will likely be faced with the infill option anyway:

The appointed architects <a href="https://www.prp-co.uk/">PRP</a> will now draw up a planning application for the Council to submit to its planning committee in late 2020.
