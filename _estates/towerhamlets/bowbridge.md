52 homes are earmarked for demolition on the Bow Bridge estate in Tower Hamlets.

Poplar HARCA plans to demolish an 11 storey tower (Warren House), a row of shops with dwellings above, and a GP surgery. Poplar HARCA proposes to build 130 new homes of which just 37 will be affordable (of these only 24 will be social rent).

The scheme has been [granted an exemption](/approved/ballotexemptions) from the Mayor's requirement to ballot residents on the demolition of their homes.

Outline planning for the scheme was approved by Tower Hamlets in 2012 (ref PA/10/00373).

A Compulsory Purchase Order was submitted in 2017 to remove the removing leaseholders and shopkeepers.
