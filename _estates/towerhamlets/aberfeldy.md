225 homes remain under threat of demolition at Poplar HARCA's redevelopment of the Aberfeldy estate in Tower Hamlets.

The estate was transferred from Tower Hamlets to Poplar HARCA in 2007 under a stock transfer agreement.

The estate borders the River Lea to the East, Balfron Tower to the West and the Robin Hood Gardens estate to the South. Poplar HARCA have already come under [criticism](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/sep/19/balfron-20-how-goldfingers-utopian-tower-became-luxury-flats) for its privatisation of Balfron Tower.

The scheme is part of Poplar HARCA's [‘Poplar Reshaping’ masterplan](https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/download?ac=1222139) which envisages the redevelopment of ten estates: Aberfeldy, Brownfield, Bow Bridge, Coventry Cross, Burdett, Devons, Lansbury, Leopold, Lincoln and Teviot.

13 residential blocks, 24 shops, a mosque and a community hall are set for demolition in remaining phases 3-6 of what has now been [re-branded](https://ecoworldlondon.com/media/1288/aberfeldy-village-host-brochure.pdf) 'Aberfeldy Village'.

The scheme is being progressed in six phases in a joint venture with Malaysian investor, Ecoworld and will create 1176 new homes of which..

The estate originally comprised 297 homes but 72 homes were demolished in phases 1-3 which are currently approaching completion in the first stage of the scheme.

The scheme is being [funded](/approved/funding) by the Mayor. It hasn't yet applied to be [exempted](/approved/ballotexemptions) from his requirement to ballot residents on the demolition of their homes.

Compulsory purchase orders were [issued in 2016](https://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/Documents/Planning-and-building-control/Aberfeldy_SoR_140616.pdf) and confirmed in 2017 for the remaining three phases.

The [compulsory purchase order documents](https://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/Documents/Planning-and-building-control/Aberfeldy_SoR_140616.pdf) confirm that 619 new homes will replace the 225 being demolished but than only 100 will be affordable rent, the remainder will be mainly private housing.
