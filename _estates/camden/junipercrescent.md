120 homes on Camden's Juniper Crescent estate has been earmarked for redevelopment as part of the [Camden Goods Yard regeneration](https://www.camden.gov.uk/documents/20142/145786127/Site+Allocations+2020+-+05+Camden+Goods+Yard.pdf).

Camden's Juniper Crescent was balloted jointly with neighbouring twin estate Gilbey's Yard in 2020. This ballot was the first under the Mayor of London's new scheme to be rejected by residents.

After a period of re-assessment, One Housing Group and Riverside have decided to once again target Juniper Crescent's 120 homes separately from Gilbey's Yard. In Juniper Crescent, the most densely populated of the two estates, several long-term households have already been decanted. Unlike Gilbey's Yard, they did not at the time have an active Tenants and Residents Association.

Juniper Crescent was only built in 1996. It is strategically located right behind the Roundhouse and next to the Camden Stables Market. Its discreet, three-storey brick profile is directly in sight of both the Chalk Farm Road and Primrose Hill's Gloucester Avenue, right across the rail tracks. One Housing Group have announced 50% of the land it stands on is to be fully privatised in case of redevelopment. The building proposed will be a high density, high rise development.

In the first six months of 2022, One Housing's Regeneration team have knocked on doors relentlessly and carried out frequent events on the estate green without prior consultation with residents or the community organisation which preceded the newly formed TRA. During these events, live music was played and free food and drink were offered in exchange for resident engagement on the redevelopment plans.

Since the first demolition plans were made in 2019, One Housing and Riverside have filled the vacant homes (on both estates) with short-term intermediate rent tenants, who have severely limited democratic rights in the upcoming ballot. This is currently the subject of a dispute that has involved local Councillors. As of June 2022, One Housing Group maintain they are simply acting on the Mayor of London's guidance and are not to be held accountable for their voting exclusion.

In breach of the promises made during the previous ballot and as stated in the Landlord Offer, essential maintenance of the buildings has consistently been neglected, with most units displaying window and door frames well beyond repair.

As of June 30th, 2022, Juniper Crescent residents had received no clarity on the amount of social housing proposed, information about proposed tenures and security of tenure, space standards, breakdowns of Service Charges and Council Tax on the redeveloped estate. One Housing Group representatives have communicated verbally to a number of residents that a Masterplan will be released in mid-July, with a new ballot still being planned for Autumn 2022.

There has been no time allowed for an options appraisal to take place as required in the Mayors Guidance. The previous options appraisal undertaken for the first ballot was for both estates and not for Juniper Crescent alone, so this requires a complete re-evaluation.

The TRA have also not had the opportunity to appoint their own choice of ITA as required in the Mayors Guidance. In the case of a second ballot, the Guidance requires that any new Landlord Offer made is substantially different from the previous offer and that it is negotiated by a steering group comprising of tenants and residents from the estate, prior to any final Landlord Offer and ballot in order to secure the best possible terms for the residents.

None of these issues have been broached in any way by One Housing Group and Riverside who are trying to push through the ballot regardless. Â
