Circa 50 Council homes are set for demolition in Aspen House as part of Camden's [regeneration of Maitland Park estate](https://www.camden.gov.uk/maitland-park).

Camden started decanting tenants from Aspen House in 2013 and a planning application was approved in February 2015. Delays meant that the last secure tenants were moved out in September 2019 and the remaining flats have been [occupied by property guardians](https://uk.vps-guardians.com/bookonline/locations-building.jsp?id=-7814773019304955797). In February 2020 it was [reported](http://camdennewjournal.com/article/mystery-of-fire-death-of-man-in-demolition-council-block) that a man had died in a blaze in one of the flats.

The [Camden Journal article](http://camdennewjournal.com/article/mystery-of-fire-death-of-man-in-demolition-council-block) also hears from former tenant Kristian Lawton, a former Aspen House tenant, who said: _“I was told I could move back when the new block is built – that was in April 2017. I haven’t heard anything since from the council and this is the first I have heard that the block is actually being demolished. We were promised that the new block would be finished within two years.”_
