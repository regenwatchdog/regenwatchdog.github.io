241 homes plus a health centre and nursery on Camden's Wendling estate have been [earmarked for demolition](https://www.camden.gov.uk/wendling-estate-and-st-stephens-close) in a 2019 options appraisal.  

In July 2019, the Council's Cabinet [decided](http://democracy.camden.gov.uk/documents/s81826/12%20The%20Future%20of%20Wendling%20Estate.pdf) that its preferred option is full redevelopment and resolved to ballot residents on this option.

The decision was the cause of some unrest among residents, reported in the local press (April 2020):

The Wendling estate overlooks the site of the former Bacton estate where Camden resolved to redevelop 100 council homes 10 years ago. 67 new private and 'affordable' homes were completed on the adjacent 'phase 1' of that scheme in 2015 but in 2020 the main plot of the former estate remains an empty building site.

In July 2021, Camden held a ballot of residents in which 75% of eligible residents voted in favour of redevelopment on a 72% turn out.

Camden's [Landlord Offer](/images/wendlingoffer.pdf) ahead of the ballot makes it clear that if residents vote against demolition the Council has no immediate plans to resolve the estate's ongoing maintenance issues. As has become [common practice](https://www.estatewatch.london/approved/ballotexemptions/) in estate regeneration ballots - refurbishment was not an option on the ballot paper.

Residents have long since been reporting issues with the lack of maintenance on the estate.
