Circa 100 council homes are under threat of demolition in phase 3 of Camden's [Abbey Road estate regeneration](https://www.camden.gov.uk/abbey-road-development), which envisages the demolition of the Emminster and Hinstock blocks.

Phase 3 also involves the demolition of the Abbey Community Centre, Belsize Priory Health Centre, the parade of shops and the Lillie Langtry pub.

Phase 1 of the scheme is already completed and homes are currently being marketed by Camden's in-house marketing group: [https://thecamdencollection.co.uk/private-sale/abbey-road-cross](https://thecamdencollection.co.uk/private-sale/abbey-road-cross)

The Mayor [approved funding](/approved/funding/) for the scheme in November 2018 and [exempted](/approved/ballotexemptions) exempted it from his requirement to ballot residents on the demolition of their homes.
