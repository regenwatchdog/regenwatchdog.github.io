Circa 150 homes on Bexley's Picardy Street estate in Belvedere have been earmarked for redevelopment in Bexley's [Local Plan](https://www.bexley.gov.uk/sites/bexley-cms/files/2019-02/BLP-Reg-18-Consultation-Paper-for-Publication-February-2019.pdf) - (site BV0006). 

The estate is relatively small, comprising around a dozen 4-storey blocks of maisonettes plus a row of semi-detached homes and is situated within close proximity of Belvedere station - and is within walking distance from the new Abbey Wood crossrail station.

A masterplan for the redevelopment of the estate is yet to be drawn up.
