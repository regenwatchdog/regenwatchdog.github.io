596 homes (411 social rent & 185 leasehold) are earmarked for demolition on the Lesnes estate (part of the larger Thamesmead estate) situated in the borough of Bexley.

This is the second phase of Peabody's redevelopment of the Bexley side of the Thamesmead estate. In 2017, Bexley approved the [first phase](/estates/bexley/thamesmeadsouth) highlighted below in orange:

The whole of the Bexley side of the Thamesmead estate has been earmarked for redevelopment in [this capacity study](https://www.bexley.gov.uk/sites/bexley-cms/files/2017-11/London-Borough-of-Bexley-DIFS-Higher-Growth-Report.pdf) commissioned by Bexley Council. 

The Lesnes estate has been identified as a priority site to come forward in the Council's [Local Plan](https://www.bexley.gov.uk/sites/bexley-cms/files/2017-11/London-Borough-of-Bexley-DIFS-Higher-Growth-Report.pdf) but a planning application is yet to come forward.

In March 2020 Peabody balloted residents on the Lesnes estate, asking them _“Are you in favour of Peabody’s proposal to include Lesnes Estate in their regeneration plans for South Thamesmead?”_

The result saw 65.4% of eligible residents taking part in the ballot, with 70.2% voting ‘yes’.

This is despite tenants being told that the rents of the new homes will increase above their current levels - albeit tiered over a period of 10 years.

In its [ballot offer to residents](https://www.thamesmeadnow.org.uk/media/3337/lesnes-estate_landlord-offer-document.pdf), Peabody also makes it clear that if residents vote against the proposals there will be no refurbishment. Instead Peabody says _'We would maintain the homes on Lesnes Estate as best we can and a new proposal would be put together with feedback from residents.'_

A [planning application](https://pa.bexley.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=QUJ3DGBE00400) was submitted in June 2021 for up to 1,950 new homes of which 61 social rent, 307 London Affordable Rent and 279 shared ownership.

Bexley's [Growth Strategy](https://www.bexley.gov.uk/sites/default/files/2018-02/Bexley-Growth-Strategy.pdf) envisages 4,000 new homes in the Thamesmead area facilitated by the new Crossrail station and including the 'renewal' of existing estates.

Peabody has [partnered with Australian developer Lendlease](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/news/peabody-picks-lendlease-for-8bn-thamesmead-regeneration-60192) (Heygate estate regeneration) to deliver 11,500 homes in Thamesmead over the next 30 years.
