258 homes in 4 blocks of the Avenue Road estate have been <a href="https://walthamforest.gov.uk/content/regeneration-avenue-road-estate-leytonstone">earmarked</a> for demolition (Blackthorn Ct, Gean Ct, Mulberry Ct, Rosewood Ct).

The estate was one of 11 estates [identified](https://democracy.walthamforest.gov.uk/documents/s10654/4.2.%20LSP%20report%20-%20Estates%20Review.pdf) for possible redevelopment in a 2010 Estates Capacity Study.

The Council appointed a residents' advisor to the scheme in 2019 (Newman Francis). Newman Francis has also been [involved in Lambeth's estate regeneration schemes](http://newmanfrancis.org/projects/westbury-lambeth/).

In April 2020, the Council [resolved](https://democracy.walthamforest.gov.uk/documents/s72449/Avenue%20Road%20Estate%20Regeneration%20report.pdf) to proceed with redevelopment on the basis of an options appraisal study but witheld publication of the study on grounds of 'commercial sensitivity.

In January 2021, Waltham Forest Council held a ballot in which 161 of the 269 eligible residents voted in favour of redevelopment. As with many such ballots, refurbishment of the estate was not an option on the ballot paper. Neither was proposed tenure mix stated, which is a requirement of the Mayor's [Ballot Funding Conditions](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/gla_cfg_section_8._resident_ballots_-_18_july_2018.pdf). 

In February 2021, the Council [resolved](https://democracy.walthamforest.gov.uk/documents/s77115/Avenue%20Road%20Estate%20Regeneration%20Project%20Update%20Report.pdf) to initiate CPO proceedings and serve a demolition notice. Again, the appendix to this report setting out the financial implications of the scheme were witheld on grounds of commercial sensitivity.
