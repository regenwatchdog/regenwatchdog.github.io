Circa 100 homes in two towers on the Montague road estate have been earmarked for redevelopment.

The estate was one of 11 estates [identified](https://democracy.walthamforest.gov.uk/documents/s10654/4.2.%20LSP%20report%20-%20Estates%20Review.pdf) for possible redevelopment in a 2010 Estates Capacity Study.

According to this <a href="https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/news/council-puts-refurbishment-on-hold-as-fire-safety-raises-costs-54857">Inside Housing article</a>, all redevelopment options have been postponed until after the Grenfell Inquiry has concluded and the building regs revised.
