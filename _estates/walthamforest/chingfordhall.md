Circa 300 homes on the Chingford Hall estate have been earmarked for renewal, according to the borough's [draft Local Plan](https://walthamforest.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Final%20Draft%20Local%20Plan_July2019_Web%20optimised_Part1.pdf).

The Council is seeking to redevelop the estate in order to establish linkages to the nearby Meridian Water regeneration, where 10,000 new homes are to be built.

The Council's Local Plan says that an additional 900 homes could be built on the estate supported by its vicinity to the North Circular.

The estate dates from the early 90s when it replaced the now-demolished [60s Chingford Hall estate](http://www.towerblock.eca.ed.ac.uk/development/chingford-hall-stage-ii) as one of the government's [Housing Action Trust](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/this-is-a-council-estate-the-government-spent-pounds-150000-on-each-house-why-1322746.html) regeneration schemes. The Waltham Forest Housing Action Trust closed down in 2002 and the homes were [transferred](https://www.peabody.org.uk/neighbourhoods/waltham-forest/chingford/about) to housing association Peabody.
