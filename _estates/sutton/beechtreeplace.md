21 homes at Beech Tree Place near Sutton Town centre are under threat of demolition by Sutton Council.

In September 2017, it was [listed](https://moderngov.sutton.gov.uk/documents/s54307/7%20Housing%20Revenue%20Account%20Business%20Plan%20201718%20-%20204647%20-%20Appendix%20A.pdf) as 'amber' in Sutton's [stock investment review](https://moderngov.sutton.gov.uk/documents/s54306/7%20Housing%20Revenue%20Account%20Business%20Plan%20201718%20-%20204647.pdf) which requires an options appraisal on the future of the building before any continued investment in its upkeep:

Beech Tree Place is also listed as a development site in Sutton's Local Plan (Site STC 11).

In November 2018, it was [reported](https://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/news/croydon-news/sutton-sheltered-housing-residents-intimidated-2218561) that residents were _'feeling intimidated and anxious'_ as a result of the Council's approach.

The Council has appointed Public Voice Ltd (formerly Strategic Urban Futures (StUF)) to conduct the consultation with residents:
