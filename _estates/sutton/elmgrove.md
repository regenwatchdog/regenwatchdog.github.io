Circa 100 homes on Sutton's Elm Grove estate have been earmarked for potential demolition.

The Elm Grove estate is a small estate situated behind Sutton High street. It comprises approximately two-dozen blocks of two or three-storey terraced housing and maisonettes. In 2018, the site was designated for redevelopment in the Council's Local plan (site STC45) and a [masterplan](https://www.sutton.gov.uk/info/200502/housing_advice_and_options/1659/elm_grove/2) was drawn up by architects Levitt Bernstein. 

The estate is one of seven estates listed in [Sutton's Local Plan (2018)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MdX6GlaHDoBdG6CTsvjFaIuPtIa9id5O/view) for potential redevelopment.

The Council has [set up a steering group](https://www.sutton.gov.uk/info/200502/housing_advice_and_options/1659/elm_grove/6) to represent residents on the estate and in February 2021 a [draft Resident's Charter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pqib0zDnHOFMbobnRhaFC-ReJKxMQ2Hh/view) was published.

A ballot is due to be held in winter 2021/2022.
