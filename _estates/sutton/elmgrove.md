Circa 100 homes on Sutton's Elm Grove estate have been earmarked for potential demolition.

The Elm Grove estate is a small estate situated behind Sutton High street. It comprises approximately two-dozen blocks of two or three-storey terraced housing and maisonettes. In 2018, the site was designated for redevelopment in the Council's Local plan (site STC45). 

The estate is one of seven estates listed in [Sutton's Local Plan (2018)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MdX6GlaHDoBdG6CTsvjFaIuPtIa9id5O/view) for potential redevelopment.

The Council has set up a steering group to represent residents on the estate, which is [currently in the process of appointing an independent tenant advisor](https://www.sutton.gov.uk/info/200502/housing_advice_and_options/1659/elm_grove/6) in anticipation of drawing up plans for the redevelopment and holding a ballot.
