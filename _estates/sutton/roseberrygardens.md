Circa 150 homes have been earmarked for demolition on Sutton's Roseberry Gardens estate.

The Roseberry Gardens estate is one of seven estates listed in [Sutton's Local Plan (2018)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MdX6GlaHDoBdG6CTsvjFaIuPtIa9id5O/view) for potential redevelopment:

The estate is also clearly marked in Sutton's [Policy Map](http://sutton.addresscafe.com/app/exploreit/) as a potential renewal area:

The estate comprises around a dozen blocks of 2-3 storey maisonettes and around a dozen rows of 2-storey terraced homes. It is located directly adjacent to the [Benhill estate](/estates/sutton/benhillestate/) which is a much larger estate, and also earmarked for redevelopment in the local plan.
