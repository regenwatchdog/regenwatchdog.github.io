243 homes are earmarked for demolition on Barnet's Whitefield estate in Cricklewood. 

The estate is being demolished and redeveloped as part of the large Brent Cross shopping centre scheme.

The development will see the construction of 7,400 new homes across the entire Brent Cross scheme of which only 15% are secured as 'affordable'. Of the affordable element 60% will be social rent and 40% intermediate housing.

In 2017 Barnet Council was granted a [compulsory purchase order](/images/whitefieldcpo.pdf) to remove the remaining leaseholders from the blocks. It is understood that the compulsory purchase order expires in 2022, by which time all remaining residents must have been 'decanted'.
