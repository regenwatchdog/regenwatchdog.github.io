Whilst there are no firm plans for the redevelopment of Granville Road estate, Barnet's [Draft Housing Strategy](https://engage.barnet.gov.uk/1726/documents/1850) describes the estate as follows: _'The quality of the estate is generally poor and it includes large areas of under-utilised and unstructured land.'_

Barnet's [Core Strategy](https://www.barnet.gov.uk/sites/default/files/assets/citizenportal/documents/planningconservationandbuildingcontrol/PlanningPolicy/LocalPlan/DPD/LocalPlanCoreStrategyDPDSeptember2012.pdf) lists the Granville Road estate as one of its _'failed housing estates'_, which _'will be subject to long term programmes of regeneration in order to tackle poor quality housing, social isolation and transform these areas into successful mixed tenure places.'_ (policy 7.2.12)
