176 homes on the Treverton estate in Ladbroke Grove were earmarked for potential redevelopment by RBKC in [a Jan 2017 Cabinet report](https://planningconsult.rbkc.gov.uk/gf2.ti/f/782882/24784549.1/PDF/-/Considerations_for_Estate_Regeneration_Proposals__Treverton_Estate_January_2017.pdf). 

Six months later the plans for all three of the borough's estate regeneration schemes were [paused](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/news/kensington-and-chelsea-council-pauses-schemes-51587) after the Grenfell disaster.

The borough's [Local Plan says](https://www.rbkc.gov.uk/sites/default/files/atoms/files/2019%20LOCAL%20PLAN%20SECTION%201%20SPATIAL%20STRATEGY.pdf) that the schemes will only now be progressed with the consent of estate residents via a ballot:
