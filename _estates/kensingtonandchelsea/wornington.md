Circa 150 homes of the 550 homes on RBKC's Wornington Green estate remain earmarked for demolition by Catalyst Housing Association, with stage 1 of 3 now complete. 

Phase 1 of the scheme is complete and phase 2 is under construction. The 'decanting' of homes on phase 3 is due to commence in late 2020 as is the consultation period prior to submission of a planning application.

Catalyst's [website](https://www.chg.org.uk/development-regeneration/regeneration/wornington-green-kensington/) describes the replacement social housing as 'affordable rent':

The Mayor <a href="/approved/funding">approved funding</a> for the scheme in 2017 and <a href="/approved/ballotexemptions">exempted</a> it from his requirement to ballot residents on the demolition of their homes.

Natasha Langridge, a temporary resident on the estate, has directed a [project recording the oral histories of residents](https://worningtonword.renegadetheatre.co.uk/). Here's one of the audio extracts from Keith Stirling - chairman of the Wornington Green Residents Association:
