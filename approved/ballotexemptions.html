			         <p class="lead text-muted" align="left">
				 Since he was elected Mayor in May 2016, Sadiq Khan has <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/list_of_exemptions.pdf">exempted</a> 44 estates from his own requirement to ballot residents on the demolition of their homes and continues to turn a blind eye to ballots offering a false choice.
				 <br><br>
An increasing number of ballots are removing the option of refurbishment from the ballot paper or substituting it for infill options.

For example, residents on the <a href="/estates/barnet/douglasbaderpark">Douglas Bader Park estate</a> were told that they would only see 'like-for-like' repairs <i>'as they are reported'</i> under the landlord's <i>'statutory duty'</i> if demolition is rejected:

Similarly, residents of the <a href="/estates/camden/junipercrescent">Juniper Crescent estate</a> in Camden were told that their estate would only receive essential maintenance and repairs as reported if they voted no:

Residents of the <a href="/estates/camden/westkentishtown">West Kentish Town estate</a> in Camden were told that if they voted against regeneration then their estate wouldn't see any major improvement for at least another 5 to 10 years:

Residents on the St Raphael's estate in Brent were told that if they voted against demolition then their homes wouldn't be improved beyond their current condition:

Residents on the <a href="/estates/towerhamlets/clichyestate">Clichy estate in Tower Hamlets</a> residents were initially consulted on an 'infill' option as well as full redevelopment. But the <a href"https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/clichy_estate_ballot_paper_accom?nocache=incoming-1565802#incoming-1565802">information</a> sent to residents along with the ballot papers asked only whether they wanted full redevelopment or not.
<br>
<br>

In addition, leaseholders were <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/658746/response/1565802/attach/4/Ballot%20information%20requested%201.pdf">told</a> that if they voted against redevelopment then they would be faced with major bills for any refurbishment.
<br>
<br>
Finally, residents were told that if they don't vote for full redevelopment then they would likely have the infill option forced upon them anyway:

In Tower Hamlets, residents of the <a href="/estates/towerhamlets/teviot/">Teviot estate</a> were similarly told that voting against regeneration would leave the estate in its current dilapidated state and face having new homes built on their roofs anyway:

This is a recurring element when it comes to estate regeneration ballots; residents are presented with generous promises of new homes while being warned with continued neglect and dis-investment or undesirable infill options if they vote no. 

This, coupled with incentives to tenants like the offer of an extra bedroom if they are overoccupying or offers of secure tenancies to temporary tenants (many secure tenants having already been rehoused) has become a winning formula for Councils and housing associations in the <a href="https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/estate-ballots-are-they-working/10046693.article">PR exercise</a> of gaining support for demolition.  
<br><br>
The Mayor has also <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/list_of_exemptions.pdf">exempted</a> 44 estates from having to comply with his ballot requirement in the first place. Some of these are exempted on the basis that he had already <a href="/approved/funding">approved funding</a> and others that he had already approved planning permission for the schemes before his ballot requirement became effective on 18 July 2018.</p>
