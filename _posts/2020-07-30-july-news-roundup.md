Many thanks to all those who have taken the time to get in touch or leave a comment on the [ESTATE WATCH website](https://estatewatch.london) telling us what's going on with their estates. Here's our monthly round-up of July's estate regeneration news:

## Alton estate regeneration - uncertainty looms 

A cloud of uncertainty has loomed over Wandsworth's regeneration of the Alton estate, since its development partner Redrow [announced](https://www.investegate.co.uk/redrow-plc--rdw-/rns/trading-statement/202006300700044407R/) that it was scaling back all but one of its London developments (the Colindale Gardens scheme) as a consequence of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.

At July's <a href="https://democracy.wandsworth.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=296&MId=6910&Ver=4">full Council meeting</a> Wandsworth's Cabinet member confirmed Redrow's decision but provided little clarification on what discussions have taken place or the implications for the Alton estate scheme.

This follows Southwark's [recent decision](https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/housing-chief-denies-aylesbury-estate-deal-is-bail-out-for-notting-hill-genesis/) to step in and stump up £193m to rescue the [Aylesbury estate regeneration](https://estatewatch.london/estates/southwark/aylesbury/) after its development partner was [forced to scale back its development pipeline](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/news/notting-hill-genesis-scales-back-development-plans-amid-changing-market-conditions-62506).

With the impending double-shock impacts of Covid-19 and Brexit, uncertainty is likely to become a recurring element within London's pipeline of estate demolition schemes, which are highly dependent on a cross-subsidy model. Progressive boroughs will now be looking increasingly to [refurbishment as a more viable and cost effective](https://estatewatch.london/refurbishment/) alternative.

## Lancaster West estate - refurbishment webinar
Some London boroughs have already understood the benefits of refurbishment. At the beginning of July, the Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea hosted a webinar to explore the feasibility of improving energy efficiency in its refurbishment of the Lancaster West Estate.

The webinar gave an introduction to sustainability, and the net-zero opportunities for Lancaster West, with an expert panel which included Professor Anne Power (London School of Economics), Lizzy Westmacott (ECD Architects), and James Traynor (ECD Architects and author of “EnerPhit: A Step by Step Guide to Low Energy Retrofit).

The refurbishment of the Lancaster West estate was funded by RBKC and the GLA - we hope to see a lot more such schemes in the pipeline now that the benefits of refurbishment are becoming more widely acknowledged. 

## Hackney runs 'pilot' ballot on De Beauvoir estate
Hackney Council has announced a 'pilot' ballot for residents on its [regeneration of the De Beauvoir estate](https://hackney.gov.uk/de-beauvoir-estate). Whilst the scheme is mainly in-fill development, six council homes and a row of shops are earmarked for demolition.

Hackney [says](http://mginternet.hackney.gov.uk/documents/s70551/200720%20ReportTrinity%20Court%20Pilot%20Ballot.pdf) that this 'pilot' ballot will help inform its policy on resident ballots for future regeneration projects, which is due to be presented to Cabinet in early Autumn.

More info is available in Hackney's Cabinet report here: [http://mginternet.hackney.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=111&MID=4912#AI36922](https://hackney.gov.uk/de-beauvoir-estate)

## Estate Watch Zoom meeting
Next week, we will be hosting a zoom meeting to provide an opportunity for residents of estates going through estate regeneration and who are at risk of demolition to come together to share and exchange with others in the same situation. We will also explore possible ongoing mutual support and effective working together.

## More estates added to Watch List 
Thanks to a number of people who took the time to get in touch, we have added 8 further estates to our list of those under threat of demolition. This brings the total number of estates under threat to 130, comprising over 40,000 homes.

The 8 additions comprise the [Geoffrey Close estate](https://estatewatch.london/estates/lambeth/geoffreyclose/) in Lambeth; the [Marlowe Road estate](https://estatewatch.london/estates/walthamforest/marloweroad/) in Waltham Forest; the [Marian Court estate](https://estatewatch.london/estates/hackney/mariancourt/) in Hackney; the [Calverley Close estate](https://estatewatch.london/estates/bromley/calverleyclose/) in Bromley; the [Ladderswood estate](https://estatewatch.london/estates/enfield/ladderswood/) in Enfield; the [Clapham Park estate](https://estatewatch.london/estates/lambeth/claphampark/) in Lambeth; the [Lansbury estate](https://estatewatch.london/estates/towerhamlets/lansbury/) in Tower Hamlets and [Denby Court](https://estatewatch.london/estates/lambeth/denbycourt/) in Lambeth.

Please keep these valuable community contributions coming - without your help there is no way of keeping tabs on the scale of London's estate demolitions. Please get in touch if we have missed an estate near you or if you have any other info on current estate demolitions: info@estatewatch.london

## More research into impacts of estate regeneration
We have updated our [research section](https://estatewatch.london/research/) of the website to include new research exploring further impacts of estate regeneration.

Professor Loretta Lees (University of Leicester) and Professor Phil Hubbard (Kings College London) have published a [policy briefing paper](https://estatewatch.london/papers/cacheresearch.pdf) for the [UK Collaborative Centre for Housing Evidence](https://housingevidence.ac.uk/).

The [briefing](https://estatewatch.london/papers/cacheresearch.pdf) uses qualitative methods to explore the impacts of decanting on the different resident groups affected by estate regeneration.
