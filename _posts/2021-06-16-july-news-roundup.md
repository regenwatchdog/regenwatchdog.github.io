## St Raphael's estate - saved from demolition

Brent Council has come to its senses and decided not to proceed with demolition of the St Raphael's estate.

In a [letter](https://www.brent.gov.uk/media/16419105/infill-plus-resident-letter-vfinal-website.pdf) recently circulated by the leader of Brent Council, residents were told that *"the redevelopment option is no longer affordable at this point 
in time"* and that the planned ballot would no longer go ahead. Instead Brent Council said it will be pursuing an in-fill option to provide extra council homes on the estate.

A [December 2019 Cabinet report](https://democracy.brent.gov.uk/documents/s92415/09.%20Cabinet%20Report_Future%20St%20Raphaels%20Masterplanning_Final%2026%2011%2019.pdf) already acknowledged that the scheme had a £22m viability gap. Brent Council deserves some credit for calling time on this scheme, although it's not clear why it didn't do so earlier.

Estate redevelopment is rarely viable but Councils often plough on nonetheless. We [pointed out last year](https://www.estatewatch.london/november-news-roundup/) that Kingston Council is stumping up nearly £200m to plug the viability gap in its regeneration of the Cambridge Road estate, along with £60m of Mayoral funding. In June we [reported](https://www.estatewatch.london/june-news-roundup/) that Westminster Council was stumping up £198m to plug the viability gap in its redevelopment of the Ebury Bridge estate.

Southwark Council is [coughing up £138m](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?AIId=57412) to see through just the first phase of its \[Aylesbury estate](https://www.estatewatch.london/estates/southwark/aylesbury/) redevelopment (not including leaseholder buyback costs, demolition or tenant rehousing costs), as well as £54m in Mayoral grant funding.

Hopefully other Councils will start following Brent's lead and realise the growing [economic, social and environmental advantages of refurbishment](https://estatewatch.london/refurbishment).

## Eastfields estate

In June, Merton's Eastfields estate was in the news after an [ITV investigation](https://www.itv.com/news/2021-06-16/collapsed-ceilings-mice-and-mould-appalling-conditions-uncovered-across-an-entire-housing-estate-of-nearly-500-homes) uncovered the apalling conditions that tenants were being made to endure in their homes.

The rats, leaks and collapsed ceilings found in the ITV report led to an inquiry by the Social Housing Regulator. But in August that inquiry cleared Clarion of any wrongdoing, finding no evidence of “organisational failure.”

It has since emerged that not a single tenant was spoken to or property inspected by the Regulator as part of the inquiry.

It also [turns out](https://www.mylondon.news/news/south-london-news/thousands-living-london-slum-estates-21308221) that the Regulator waived the ‘Decent Homes Standard’ upon Clarion’s request on the Eastfields estate in 2014, meaning housing conditions were allowed to fall below basic legal requirements a long time ago.

Ownership of the Estate was acquired by Circle Housing Group in 2010 as part of Stock Transfer Agreement containing all of Merton's council housing stock, totalling circa 9,500 homes.

The stock transfer agreement committed Circle to improving the quality of accommodation to at least Decent Homes Standard by 2015. Circle then became Clarion after its merger with Affinity Sutton and decided in 2016 to demolish instead of improve the estate, following an [options appraisal assessment](https://www.merton.gov.uk/assets/Documents/www2/eastfields_-_chmp_case_for_regen.pdf) carried out by Savills. 

The Mayor then approved £15m grant funding for the Eastfields estate scheme in June 2017 and [signed off](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/public%3A//public%3A//PAWS/media_id_437651///eastfields_estate_report.pdf) outline planning permission for the scheme in November 2018, despite it not meeting with his minimum affordable housing requirements (30% not 50% affordable and affordable rent rather than social rent).

The outline planning consent said that the scheme would be progressed in five phases over a 13-year period, each of the five phases requiring a detailed (reserved matters) planning application to be submitted. In Clarion's most recent [newsletter to tenants](https://www.myclarionhousing.com/-/jssmedia/clarion-housing-association/documents/regeneration-documents/eastfields/newsletters/20-03-eastfields-newsletter-spring-2020.ashx) (Spring 2020) it said that submission of the detailed application for phase 1 had been delayed because it was _"still reviewing our regeneration projects and costs, so we are not yet in the position to submit the planning application."_

No further information is available surrounding the ongoing and extensive delays. Clarion hasn't even drawn up a roadmap for decanting the estate. Clarion's outline permission expires in April and the GLA grant funding requires a start on site by March next year. If Clarion doesn't submit and get a reserved matters approved by then it runs the risk of losing grant funding and also its ballot exemption.


## Waterloo Road estate - 
Havering Council has approved its own application for the demolition of 290 homes on the Waterloo Road estate.
The [viability assessment](https://msp.havering.gov.uk/planning/search-applications#DOC?DocNo=2505377) submitted for the scheme, says that it cannot meet the Mayor's 50% affordable housing requirement because the scheme is not viable. i.e. the scheme only provides 6% profit for Wates (Havering's development partner) and not the 14% it says it requires..

1,380 new homes 212 SR 197 AR, 147 SO
£18.5m grant funding and £15m spent on the scheme by Havering to date.
£33.5m of public funding 
290 homes (214 council)
