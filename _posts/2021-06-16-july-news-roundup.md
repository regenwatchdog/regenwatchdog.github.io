## St Raphael's estate - saved from demolition

Brent Council has come to its senses and decided not to proceed with demolition of the St Raphael's estate.

<img src="/images/ST_raphaels_blocks.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded img-thumbnail">

In a [letter](https://www.brent.gov.uk/media/16419105/infill-plus-resident-letter-vfinal-website.pdf) recently circulated by the leader of Brent Council, residents were told that *"the redevelopment option is no longer affordable at this point 
in time"* and that the planned ballot would no longer go ahead. Instead Brent Council said it will be pursuing an in-fill option to provide extra council homes on the estate.

A [December 2019 Cabinet report](https://democracy.brent.gov.uk/documents/s92415/09.%20Cabinet%20Report_Future%20St%20Raphaels%20Masterplanning_Final%2026%2011%2019.pdf) already acknowledged that the scheme had a £22m viability gap. Credit to Brent Council for calling time on the scheme, although it's not clear why they didn't do so earlier.

Estate redevelopment is rarely viable but Councils often plough on nonetheless. We [pointed out last year](https://www.estatewatch.london/november-news-roundup/) that Kingston Council is stumping up nearly £200m to plug the viability gap in its regeneration of the Cambridge Road estate, along with £60m of Mayoral funding. In June we [reported](https://www.estatewatch.london/june-news-roundup/) that Westminster Council was stumping up £198m to plug the viability gap in its redevelopment of the Ebury Bridge estate.

Southwark Council is [coughing up £138m](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?AIId=57412) to see through just the first phase of its \[Aylesbury estate] redevelopment, not to mention the public money the Mayor...- and this doesn't even include leaseholder buyback costs or tenant rehousing costs.

## Eastfields estate

In June, Merton's Eastfields estate was in the news after an \[ITV investigation](https://www.itv.com/news/2021-06-16/collapsed-ceilings-mice-and-mould-appalling-conditions-uncovered-across-an-entire-housing-estate-of-nearly-500-homes) into the apalling conditions that tenants were being made to endure in their homes.

The rats, leaks and collapsed ceilings found in the ITV report led to an inquiry by the Social Housing Regulator.

In August that inquiry cleared Clarion of any wrongdoing, finding no evidence of “organisational failure.”

It has since emerged that not a single tenant was spoken to or property inspected by the Regulator as part of the inquiry.

It also \[turns out](https://www.mylondon.news/news/south-london-news/thousands-living-london-slum-estates-21308221) that the Regulator waived the ‘Decent Homes Standard’ on Clarion’s request on the Eastfields estate in 2014, meaning housing conditions were allowed to fall below the basic legal requirements.

The Mayor approved £15m grant funding for the Eastfields estate scheme in June 2017 and \[signed off](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/public%3A//public%3A//PAWS/media_id_437651///eastfields_estate_report.pdf) outline planning permission for the scheme in November 2018, despite it not meeting with his minimum affordable housing requirements (30% not 50% affordable and affordable rent rather than social rent).

The outline planning consent said that the scheme would be progressed in five phases over a 13-year period, each of the five phases requiring a detailed (reserved matters) planning application to be submitted. In Clarion's most recent \[newsletter to tenants](https://www.myclarionhousing.com/-/jssmedia/clarion-housing-association/documents/regeneration-documents/eastfields/newsletters/20-03-eastfields-newsletter-spring-2020.ashx) (Spring 2020) it said that submission of the detailed application for phase 1 had been delayed because it was \_"still reviewing our regeneration projects and costs, so we are not yet in the position to submit the planning application."\_

No further information is available surrounding the ongoing and extensive delays. Clarion hasn't even drawn up a roadmap for decanting the estate. Clarion's outline permission expires in April next year - if it doesn't submit a reserved matters by then it will ...

ownership and management of the Estate was acquired by Circle Housing Merton Priory (CHMP), who are part of the wider Circle Housing Group,in 2010 as part of aHousing Stock TransferAgreement (HSTA) containingall LBM’s council housing stock within Merton, totalling circa 9,500units.

When CHMP acquired responsibility for the EastfieldsEstate, as well as all other LBM council housing stockin 2010,CHMP committed to improving the quality of accommodation to at leastDecent HomesMerton Standard1by 2015to improve the quality of life for residents of the Estate.

## Waterloo Road estate - 
Havering Council has approved its own application for the demolition of 290 homes on the Waterloo Road estate.
The [viability assessment](https://msp.havering.gov.uk/planning/search-applications#DOC?DocNo=2505377) submitted for the scheme, says that it cannot meet the Mayor's 50% affordable housing requirement because the scheme is not viable. i.e. the scheme only provides 6% profit for Wates (Havering's development partner) and not the 14% it says it requires..

1,380 new homes 212 SR 197 AR, 147 SO
£18.5m grant funding and £15m spent on the scheme by Havering to date.
