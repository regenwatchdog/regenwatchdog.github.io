## St Raphael's estate - saved from demolition

Brent Council has come to its senses and decided not to proceed with demolition of the St Raphael's estate.

In a [letter](https://www.brent.gov.uk/media/16419105/infill-plus-resident-letter-vfinal-website.pdf) recently circulated by the leader of Brent Council, residents were told that *"the redevelopment option is no longer affordable at this point 
in time"* and that the planned ballot would no longer go ahead. Instead Brent Council said it will be pursuing an in-fill option to provide extra council homes on the estate.

A [December 2019 Cabinet report](https://democracy.brent.gov.uk/documents/s92415/09.%20Cabinet%20Report_Future%20St%20Raphaels%20Masterplanning_Final%2026%2011%2019.pdf) already acknowledged that the scheme had a £22m viability gap. Brent Council deserves some credit for calling time on this scheme, although it's not clear why it didn't do so earlier.

Estate redevelopment is rarely viable but Councils often plough on nonetheless. We [pointed out last year](https://www.estatewatch.london/november-news-roundup/) that Kingston Council is stumping up nearly £200m to plug the viability gap in its regeneration of the Cambridge Road estate, along with £60m of Mayoral funding. In June we [reported](https://www.estatewatch.london/june-news-roundup/) that Westminster Council was stumping up £198m to plug the viability gap in its redevelopment of the Ebury Bridge estate.

Southwark Council is [coughing up £138m](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?AIId=57412) to see through just the first phase of its \[Aylesbury estate](https://www.estatewatch.london/estates/southwark/aylesbury/) redevelopment (not including leaseholder buyback costs, demolition or tenant rehousing costs), as well as £54m in Mayoral grant funding.

Hopefully other Councils will start following Brent's lead and realise the growing [economic, social and environmental advantages of refurbishment](https://estatewatch.london/refurbishment).

## Eastfields estate

In June, Merton's Eastfields estate was in the news after an [ITV investigation](https://www.itv.com/news/2021-06-16/collapsed-ceilings-mice-and-mould-appalling-conditions-uncovered-across-an-entire-housing-estate-of-nearly-500-homes) uncovered the apalling conditions that tenants were being made to endure in their homes.

<img src="/images/screenshot-2021-08-18-at-09-04-28-10-daniel-hewitt-danielhewittitv-twitter.png" class="img-fluid rounded img-thumbnail">

The rats, leaks and collapsed ceilings found in the ITV report led to an inquiry by the Social Housing Regulator. But in August that inquiry cleared Clarion of any wrongdoing, finding no evidence of “organisational failure.”

It has since emerged that not a single tenant was spoken to or property inspected by the Regulator as part of the inquiry.

It also [turns out](https://www.mylondon.news/news/south-london-news/thousands-living-london-slum-estates-21308221) that the Regulator waived the ‘Decent Homes Standard’ upon Clarion’s request on the Eastfields estate in 2014, meaning housing conditions were allowed to fall below basic legal requirements a long time ago.

Ownership of the Estate was acquired by Circle Housing Group in 2010 as part of Stock Transfer Agreement containing all of Merton's council housing stock, totalling circa 9,500 homes.

The stock transfer agreement committed Circle to improving the quality of accommodation to at least Decent Homes Standard by 2015. Circle then became Clarion after its merger with Affinity Sutton and decided in 2016 to demolish instead of improve the estate, following an [options appraisal assessment](https://www.merton.gov.uk/assets/Documents/www2/eastfields_-_chmp_case_for_regen.pdf) carried out by Savills. 

The Mayor then approved £15m grant funding for the Eastfields estate scheme in June 2017 and [signed off](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/public%3A//public%3A//PAWS/media_id_437651///eastfields_estate_report.pdf) outline planning permission for the scheme in November 2018, despite it not meeting with his minimum affordable housing requirements (30% not 50% affordable and affordable rent rather than social rent).

The outline planning consent said that the scheme would be progressed in five phases over a 13-year period, each of the five phases requiring a detailed (reserved matters) planning application to be submitted. In Clarion's most recent [newsletter to tenants](https://www.myclarionhousing.com/-/jssmedia/clarion-housing-association/documents/regeneration-documents/eastfields/newsletters/20-03-eastfields-newsletter-spring-2020.ashx) (Spring 2020) it said that submission of the detailed application for phase 1 had been delayed because it was _"still reviewing our regeneration projects and costs, so we are not yet in the position to submit the planning application."_

No further information is available surrounding the ongoing and extensive delays. Clarion hasn't even drawn up a roadmap for decanting the estate. Clarion's outline permission expires in April and the GLA grant funding requires a start on site by March next year. If Clarion doesn't submit and get a reserved matters approved by then it runs the risk of losing grant funding and also its ballot exemption.


## Waterloo Road estate - plans approved with net loss of 2 social rented homes
Havering's planning committee has [narrowly approved plans](https://democracy.havering.gov.uk/documents/s52710/SPC%20-%20Final%20-%20Waterloo%20Committee%20Report%20-%20John%20K.pdf) for the estate's redevelopment allowing the demolition of the estate's 290 existing homes (214 of which council homes and 76 leasehold) and replacement with 1,380 new homes. Despite quadrupling the density of the site only 212 of the new homes will be social rented tenure.

The application does also secure 197 homes at (London) affordable rent and 147 shared ownership, while the remaining 844 homes will all be private for-sale units.

The scheme is being [funded](/approved/funding) by the Mayor and has been exempted from his [requirement](/approved/ballotexemptions) to ballot residents on the demolition of their homes.

The [viability assessment](https://msp.havering.gov.uk/planning/search-applications#DOC?DocNo=2505377) submitted for the scheme, says that it cannot provide more social rented homes or meet the Mayor's 50% affordable housing requirement because the scheme is not viable. - i.e. the scheme only provides 6% profit for Wates (Havering's development partner) and not the 14% the viability assessment says that it requires.

The viability assessment also shows that the Mayor is providing £18.5m grant funding to the Council and its development partner for the redevelopment of the estate. It also states that Havering Council has spent over £15m decanting the estate (para 7.15). There is nothing in the planning application explaining how it complies with the Mayor's policy requirement that demolition is being pursued as a last resort and no cost/benefit analysis to show that the £33.5m in public funds couldn't have been better spent on refurbishment or in-fill development.

Havering's [re-housing offer](https://www.havering.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/1877/information_for_property_owners.pdf) for leaseholders displaced by their schemes is by far one of the poorest in comparison with other London boroughs.

It makes no provision for the gap between the value leaesholders receive for their current homes and the cost of the replacement new-builds. It simply gives them 'first refusal' on the purchase of a new home - if they can afford it..



## Wendling estate - ballot approved

Also Calverley Close

and Barkantine estate

This combined with the offer of upsizing for overcrowded households and secure tenancies for temporary tenants as well as pressure exerted by landlords is .. ballots run..
