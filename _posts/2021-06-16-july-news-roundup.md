## St Raphael's estate - saved from demolition
Brent Council has come to its senses and decided not to proceed with demolition of the St Raphael's estate.

In a [letter](https://www.brent.gov.uk/media/16419105/infill-plus-resident-letter-vfinal-website.pdf) recently circulated by the leader of Brent Council, residents were told that _"the redevelopment option is no longer affordable at this point 
in time"_ and that the planned ballot would no longer go ahead. Instead Brent Council said it will be pursuing an in-fill option to provide extra council homes on the estate.

A [December 2019 Cabinet report](https://democracy.brent.gov.uk/documents/s92415/09.%20Cabinet%20Report_Future%20St%20Raphaels%20Masterplanning_Final%2026%2011%2019.pdf) already acknowledged that the scheme had a £22m viability gap. Credit to Brent Council for calling time on the scheme, although it's not clear why they didn't do so earlier.

Some argue that estate regenerations are rarely financially viable (not to mention environmentally and socially) and that they are more the product of an ideological approach. A grand slam approach and not the result of a detailed and diligent cost/benefit analysis. Once the machine is set rolling it gains political traction and then becomes difficult to stop.

Figures suggest that
We pointed out last year that Kingston Council is stumping up nearly £200m to plug the viability gap in its regeneration of the Cambridge Road estate. In June we [reported](https://www.estatewatch.london/june-news-roundup/) that Westminster Council was stumping up £198m to plug the viability gap in its redevelopment of the Ebury Bridge estate.

Southwark Council is [coughing up £138m](https://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?AIId=57412) to see through just the first phase of its [Aylesbury estate] redevelopment, not to mention the public money the Mayor...- and this doesn't even include leaseholder buyback costs or tenant rehousing costs.

The proposals are to refurbish existing homes at James Riley Point, Lund Point and Biggerstaff Terrace.

Homes and buildings in Dennison Point, Gibbins Road, Doran Walk, Jupp Road, Kennard Road, Rosher Close, Warton Road and Wilmer Lea Close would be demolished and rebuilt.

Newham estimates renewing the estate will provide about 2,000 new and 300 refurbished homes.
