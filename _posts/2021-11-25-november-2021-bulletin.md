Here's our quick round-up of the latest news from our estates under threat.

## MTVH appoints developer for its redevelopment of Clapham Park estate
Metropolitan Thames Valley housing association has signed a joint venture agreement with developer Countryside Ltd. for the redevelopment of its Clapham Park estate in Lambeth. 

The deal seals the demolition of the estate's 864 remaining homes and their replacement by 2,500 new homes. The Clapham Park estate was transferred to MTVH from Lambeth Council in 2006 in a stock transfer. Just under half of the estate's original 1,448 homes have already been demolished, with the remainder remaining in limbo after the masterplan was revised in 2018.
