Here's a quick round-up of the latest news from our estates under threat.

## Westminster issues CPO notice to remaining Ebury estate residents

Westminster Council has [issued](https://www.westminster.gov.uk/data-protection/ebury-bridge-estate-compulsory-purchase-order-cpo) a compulsory purchase order to remaining residents on its [Ebury Bridge estate](https://www.estatewatch.london/estates/westminster/eburybridge/).

The Council's [Statement of Reasons](https://www.westminster.gov.uk/media/document/ebury-bridge---cpo-statement-of-reasons) supporting the order, claims that there is no alternative to demolition despite it not having assessed whether the circa Â£200m it is spending on demolition could better be spent on refurbishment and infill.

It also acknowledges that residents haven't been balloted on the demolition of their homes, claiming that a ballot is not required because Mayoral funding is not being sought.

This ignores the Mayor's policy requirement to seek funding in order to maximise affordable housing and his requirement to explore alternatives to demolition.  

Unfortunately the Mayor signed off his approval for the scheme in xx x without raising any of these issues.

30 remaining leaseholders and handful of commercial leaseholders incuding a cafe, hairdressers and pharmacy.

## MTVH appoints developer for its redevelopment of Clapham Park estate

Metropolitan Thames Valley housing association has signed a joint venture agreement with developer Countryside Ltd. for the redevelopment of its Clapham Park estate in Lambeth. 

The deal seals the demolition of the estate's 864 remaining homes and their replacement by 2,500 new homes. The Clapham Park estate was transferred to MTVH from Lambeth Council in 2006 in a stock transfer. Just under half of the estate's original 1,448 homes have already been demolished, with the remainder remaining in limbo after the masterplan was revised in 2018.
