Here's a quick round-up of the latest news from our estates under threat.

## Westminster issues CPO notice to remaining Ebury estate residents

Westminster Council has [issued](https://www.westminster.gov.uk/data-protection/ebury-bridge-estate-compulsory-purchase-order-cpo) a compulsory purchase order to remaining residents on its [Ebury Bridge estate](https://www.estatewatch.london/estates/westminster/eburybridge/).

The Council's [Statement of Reasons](https://www.westminster.gov.uk/media/document/ebury-bridge---cpo-statement-of-reasons) supporting the order, claims that there is no alternative to demolition despite it not having assessed whether the circa £200m it is spending on demolition could better be spent on refurbishment and infill.

It also acknowledges that residents haven't been balloted on the demolition of their homes, claiming that a ballot is not required because Mayoral funding is not being sought.

This ignores the Mayor's policy requirement to seek funding in order to maximise affordable housing and his requirement to explore alternatives to demolition.  

Unfortunately the Mayor [signed off his approval](https://idoxpa.westminster.gov.uk/online-applications/files/A3C491F071D3CB2DC5CC0848CFFD2F35/pdf/20_04366_COOUT-GLA_STAGE_2_CASE_REPORT-6995197.pdf) for the scheme in August last year, without raising any of these issues.

The CPO applies to the 30 remaining leaseholders and handful of commercial leaseholders incuding a cafe, hairdressers and pharmacy. You can read more about the redevelopment of the Ebury Bridge estate [here](https://www.estatewatch.london/estates/westminster/eburybridge/).

## Mayor waives through Wandsworth's plans despite numerous policy breaches

Both the Mayor's [stage 1 and stage 2 reports](https://planning.london.gov.uk/pr/s/planning-application/a0i4J000006cBWyQAM/20211288?tabset-c2f3b=2) are entirely silent on Wandsworth's failure to explore alternative options and demonstrate that demolition is being pursued as a last resort.

The Mayor's (Jan 2022) stage 2 report does raise concern about the low levels of affordable housing but then goes on to approve Wandsworth's planning consent.

Likewise the report is critical of Wandsworth's failure to apply for grant funding and ballot residents but then goes on to approve the planning consent.

The Mayor's report is also highly critical of Wandsworth's viability testing, viability review mechanism and failure to utilise the £105m of HRA funding it has allocated to the scheme to improve the affordable housing offer (paras 111-115).

Despite these numerous failures to comply with the Mayor's policy requirements, the report concludes that on balance the Mayor is happy with Wandsworth's decision to pursue redevelopment of the estate.

In the meantime, estate residents have been getting organised and have launched a [petition](https://www.altonaction.org/petition) to promote their alternative [Peoples' Plan](https://www.altonaction.org/resources), which puts forward an alternative to demolition.

## MTVH appoints developer for its redevelopment of Clapham Park estate

Metropolitan Thames Valley housing association has signed a joint venture agreement with developer Countryside Ltd. for the redevelopment of its Clapham Park estate in Lambeth. 

The deal seals the demolition of the estate's 864 remaining homes and their replacement by 2,500 new homes. The Clapham Park estate was transferred to MTVH from Lambeth Council in 2006 in a stock transfer. Just under half of the estate's original 1,448 homes have already been demolished, with the remainder remaining in limbo after the masterplan was revised in 2018.
