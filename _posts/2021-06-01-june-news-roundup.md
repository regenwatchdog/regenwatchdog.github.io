## Douglas Bader Park estate - plans rejected
Barnet's planning committee has gone against officer recommendations and unexpectedly [rejected](https://barnet.moderngov.co.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=703&MId=10137&Ver=4) housing association Home Group's application to demolish the Douglas Bader Park estate.

<img src="/images/db3.png" class="img-fluid rounded img-thumbnail">

The reasons for refusal are unclear from the [minutes](https://barnet.moderngov.co.uk/documents/g10137/Printed%20minutes%2001st-Jun-2021%2019.00%20Strategic%20Planning%20Committee.pdf?T=1) of the 1st June committee meeting. They simply state that the application was rejected by 7 votes to 4 and that reasons for refusal will be agreed formally at the next committee meeting.

Labour Councillor [Gill Sargeant](https://barnet.moderngov.co.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=157) addressed the committee in objection to the scheme but there is no record in the minutes of what she said. As such it can only be speculated at this stage what the grounds of refusal are.

Possible grounds could include the low level of affordable housing proposed (36% by unit) or that despite tripling the density and receiving GLA grant funding, the scheme is providing an uplift of just one extra social housing unit - albeit at London Affordable Rent not traditional social rent.

The application also failed to comply with the Mayor's policy requirement to publish a viability assessment showing that the maximum level of affordable housing is being provided. The Mayor requires a minimum of 50% affordable housing on estate regenerations and it also has a ['strategic partnership'](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/news/six-partnerships-announced-as-490m-grant-allocated-59289) agreement with Home Group requiring it to provide at least 60% affordable housing.

Home Group has failed to comply with the Mayor's policy requiring evidence to show that demolition is being pursued as a last resort and its plans also propose the felling of 160 mature trees, 51 of which covered by Tree Preservation Orders. But perhaps the more compelling reasons for refusal might have been the [Comments](https://publicaccess.barnet.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=neighbourComments&keyVal=QLUOGJJI09100&neighbourCommentsPager.page=4) submitted by estate residents who are clearly very unhappy with the way that the housing association is managing the scheme:

## Cundy Street estate

Meanwhile, Westminster Council has approved Grosvenor's application for the demolition of 111 private and 44 social rented homes on the [Cundy Street estate](https://www.estatewatch.london/estates/westminster/cundystreet/).

<img src="/images/cundy3.png" class="img-fluid rounded img-thumbnail">

Grosvenor plans to replace them with 139 homes for luxury senior living accommodation plus 93 'affordable' of which 44 social rent and 49 intermediate rent.

Westminster did publish Grosvenor's [viability assessment](https://idoxpa.westminster.gov.uk/online-applications/files/95BB21391E1D917B7E1E2A471BFEE830/pdf/20_03307_FULL-FINANCIAL_VIABILITY_ASSESSMENT-6839837.pdf) for the scheme, which said it couldn't afford to provide any more affordable housing because the scheme was only estimated to produce £71m of the £121m profit it says it requires.

<img src="/images/csfva.png" class="img-fluid rounded img-thumbnail">

The viability assessment also shows that Grosvenor hasn't applied for GLA grant funding, which would have enabled it to provide more affordable housing, despite the Mayor's policy requirement that estate regenerations seek grant funding to maximise the provision of affordable housing. 

Again, no detailed evidence was supplied showing how the demolition proposals comply with the Mayor's policy requiring demolition to be pursued only as a last resort.

or browse the planning application supporting documents on Westminster's planning portal [here](https://idoxpa.westminster.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=QB2X8DRP06A00) - (ref:20/03307/FULL).

## Ebury Bridge estate
The approval comes shortly after Westminster approved the nearby [Ebury Bridge estate](https://www.estatewatch.london/estates/westminster/eburybridge/) demolition.

The estate comprising 336 homes (198 social rent/138 leasehold) is due to be replaced by 781 homes of which 239 social rent - an uplift of just 41 social rented units despite more than doubling the density.

<img src="/images/eb2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded img-thumbnail" width="50%">

The estate is being redeveloped by the Council itself and demolition is already partly underway.

Figures in the planning application [supporting documents](https://idoxpa.westminster.gov.uk/online-applications/files/33305033EC2B493EF178E8AB19BB85FF/pdf/20_04366_COOUT-FINANCIAL_VIABILITY_ASSESSMENT_REV01-6774119.pdf) show that Westminster Council is spending a staggering £108m on decanting and demolishing the estate and that despite the replacement social housing being partly cross-subsidised by the new private homes, it is estimated that Westminster will have to fork out a further £90m during the course of the estate's redevelopment.

Yet again there is nothing in the planning application documents showing that demolition is being pursued as a last resort. 

Neither of these two westminster schemes have been signed off by the Mayor yet, so it is open to him to call them in and decide on the applications himself.

Given the significant public subsidy involved, the housing crisis and the Mayor's recent [declaration](https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/mayor-declares-a-retrofit-revolution) of a *"‘retrofit revolution’ to tackle the climate emergency"* one might expect the Mayor to exercise his call-in powers to explore whether £198m of public money might be better spent on the [environmental, economic and social benefits](https://www.estatewatch.london/refurbishment/) of refurbishment.

## Aylesbury estate
Southwark's [Cabinet member for Climate Emergency and Sustainable Development](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/councillors-and-mps/leader-of-the-council-and-cabinet-members?chapter=6) has [announced](https://twitter.com/helendennis80/status/1395336950962327552) that 80 homes on remaining phases of the [Aylesbury estate](https://www.estatewatch.london/estates/southwark/aylesbury/) have been [refurbished to be let out as temporary accommodation](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/2021/may/southwark-council-to-provide-temporary-housing-for-80-homeless-people-on-aylesbury-estate-while-581-council-homes-are-being-built) to families on the Council's housing waiting list.

<img src="/images/hdtweet.png" class="img-fluid rounded img-thumbnail">

The homes have been refurbished to [Southwark Good Homes Standard](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/2021/mar/new-southwark-council-good-homes-standard-for-temporary-accommodation) and will be available to let from July until the phase of the estate is 'decanted'. The Aylesbury estate is London's largest estate redevelopment and is set to take 15 years to complete. Approximately 700 of the estate's 2,759 homes have been demolished to date and phase 1 of 4 is currently under construction.

Southwark Council has spent at least £50m on the Aylesbury scheme to date with a further £193m of council funds committed to phase 1 alone, with no net increase in the number of social rented homes.
  
This begs an obvious question: if these homes can be refurbished to acceptable standards for habitation, why are they being knocked down?

In response to the climate crisis, Southwark, along with many other boroughs and the Mayor has [declared a climate emergency](https://www.southwark.gov.uk/environment/climate-emergency?displaypref=large&chapter=2) and is due to publish its climate Change Strategy later this year.

Might Southwark be coming to its senses and seeing that refurbishment is the more viable option, [economically, socially and environmentally](https://www.estatewatch.london/refurbishment/)?
