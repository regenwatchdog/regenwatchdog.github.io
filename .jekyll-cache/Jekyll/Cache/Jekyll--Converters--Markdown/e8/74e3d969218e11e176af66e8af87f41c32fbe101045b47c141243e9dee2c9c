I"±<p>Circa 200 homes remain earmarked for demolition on Hackneyâ€™s Colville estate.</p>

<p>Phases 1 and 2 of the scheme are nearing completion and the decant has now started on phase 3 of the 7 phase scheme.</p>

<p>Circa 900 homes have already been demolished in the first two phases. Phase 3 of the scheme was granted planning permission in Summer 2019. The scheme proposes to build 5,500 new homes in total over eight phases of development by 2029, 41% of which will be â€˜affordableâ€™.</p>

<p>The estate has been sold by Hackney Council in a phased conditional agreement to a joint venture between developer Berkeley Homes and Notting Hill Genesis housing association (cf. Aylesbury estate).</p>

<p>In August 2019, it was <a href="https://www.hackneycitizen.co.uk/2019/08/20/handful-leaseholders-council-plans-woodberry-down-redevelopment/">reported</a> that <em>â€œ42 per cent of the homes for private sale in the scheme have gone to overseas buyers, with a predicted net loss by the Town Hall of just over 300 social rented homes.â€</em> and that <em>â€œNotting Hill Genesis have been actively seeking to prevent leaseholders taking up shared equity properties in favour of shared ownerships which would yield rental incomeâ€</em>.</p>

<p>The scheme is being <a href="/approved/funding">funded</a> by the Mayor and <a href="/approved/ballotexemptions">exempted</a> from his requirement to ballot residents on the demolition of their homes.</p>
