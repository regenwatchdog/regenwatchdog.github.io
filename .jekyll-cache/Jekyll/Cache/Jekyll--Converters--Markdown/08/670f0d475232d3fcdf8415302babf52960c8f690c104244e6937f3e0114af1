<p>In October 2018, Ealing Council <a href="https://ealing.cmis.uk.com/ealing/Document.ashx?czJKcaeAi5tUFL1DTL2UE4zNRBcoShgo=T29KJkkv6%2B%2FEOf%2F4pv0XwtQAUSiI7enW%2FlmOaGncZVyUQOQgHSXqXw%3D%3D&amp;rUzwRPf%2BZ3zd4E7Ikn8Lyw%3D%3D=pwRE6AGJFLDNlh225F5QMaQWCtPHwdhUfCZ%2FLUQzgA2uL5jNRG4jdQ%3D%3D&amp;mCTIbCubSFfXsDGW9IXnlg%3D%3D=hFflUdN3100%3D&amp;kCx1AnS9%2FpWZQ40DXFvdEw%3D%3D=hFflUdN3100%3D&amp;uJovDxwdjMPoYv%2BAJvYtyA%3D%3D=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&amp;FgPlIEJYlotS%2BYGoBi5olA%3D%3D=NHdURQburHA%3D&amp;d9Qjj0ag1Pd993jsyOJqFvmyB7X0CSQK=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&amp;WGewmoAfeNR9xqBux0r1Q8Za60lavYmz=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&amp;WGewmoAfeNQ16B2MHuCpMRKZMwaG1PaO=ctNJFf55vVA%3D">resolved</a> to extend the regeneration involving the further demolition of circa 100 homes in a fourth phase.</p>

<p>Whilst phase 3 has received in-principle agreement for grant funding from the Mayor, it is exempt from the Mayor’s requirement to ballot residents because there are less than 150 homes proposed for demolition.</p>
