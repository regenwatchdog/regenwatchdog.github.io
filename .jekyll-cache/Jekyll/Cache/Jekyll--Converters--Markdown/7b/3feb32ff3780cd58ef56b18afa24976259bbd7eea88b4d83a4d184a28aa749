I"’<p>Circa 1,000 homes on Hackneyâ€™s Woodberry Down estate near Finsbury Park remain under threat of demolition.</p>

<p>Circa 900 homes have already been demolished in the first two phases. Phase 3 of the scheme was granted planning permission in Summer 2019. The scheme proposes to build 5,500 new homes in total over eight phases of development by 2029, 41% of which will be â€˜affordableâ€™.</p>

<p>The estate has been sold by Hackney Council in a phased conditional agreement to a joint venture between developer Berkeley Homes and Notting Hill Genesis housing association (cf. Aylesbury estate).</p>

<p>In August 2019, it was <a href="https://www.hackneycitizen.co.uk/2019/08/20/handful-leaseholders-council-plans-woodberry-down-redevelopment/">reported</a> that <em>â€œ42 per cent of the homes for private sale in the scheme have gone to overseas buyers, with a predicted net loss by the Town Hall of just over 300 social rented homes.â€</em> and that <em>â€œNotting Hill Genesis have been actively seeking to prevent leaseholders taking up shared equity properties in favour of shared ownerships which would yield rental incomeâ€</em>.</p>

<p>The scheme is being <a href="/approved/funding">funded</a> by the Mayor and <a href="/approved/ballotexemptions">exempted</a> from his requirement to ballot residents on the demolition of their homes.</p>

<p>The first â€˜kick-startâ€™ phase one of the scheme was <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/planning-applications-and-decisions/planning-application-search/woodberry-down-estate-kick-start-site-one-0">approved in 2008</a> and completed in 2012.</p>

<p>The outline planning application for the remaining phases of the scheme was approved in 2014. The <a href="/images/woodberrys106.pdf">section 106 agreement</a> for the outline scheme secures 36% affordable housing in phase 2, 41% in phases 3,4 and 5; and 43% in phases 6, 7 and 8.</p>

<p>36% of the affordable housing in phase 2 is secured as social rent and 47% in phases 3,4 and 5 but the tenure split in the last three phases will determined by a viability assessment to be submitted by Berkeley when those phases are progressed.</p>
