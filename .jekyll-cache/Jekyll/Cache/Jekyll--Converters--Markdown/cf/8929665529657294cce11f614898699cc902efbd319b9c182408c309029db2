I"à<p>171 homes on Enfieldâ€™s New Avenue estate have been approved for demolition with just 60 replacement properties at â€˜social rentâ€™.</p>

<p>Enfield Council signed a joint-venture agreement with developer Countryside Properties for the redevelopment of the estate in 2015.</p>

<p>Phase one of the three phase scheme has been demolished and is nearing completion. Remaining phases are still occupied but in the process of beeing â€˜decantedâ€™.</p>

<p>The estate is being replaced by 408 new homes of which only 34% will be â€˜affordableâ€™ despite the Mayorâ€™s policy requirement of 50% in estate regeneration schemes.</p>

<p>In December 2017 Enfield <a href="/images/newavenuesr.pdf">set out its intention</a> to provide just 60 social rented replacement units, the remainder of the â€˜affordable housingâ€™ being for affordable rent (up to 80% market rent) or intermediate affordable.</p>

<p>The section 106 agreement is not publicly available on Enfieldâ€™s planning portal so it is not clear whether these 60 social rented homes have been secured as such or in perpetuity.</p>

<p>The scheme is being <a href="/approval/funding">funded</a> by the Mayor and has been exempted from his <a href="/approved/ballotrequirements">ballot requirements</a>.</p>

<p>Countryside have started <a href="https://www.countrysideproperties.com/all-developments/london/new-avenue">marketing</a> new phase 1 homes off-plan on the redeveloped estate for prices starting at Â£600k.</p>

<p>There is no provision on the redeveloped estate for the estateâ€™s 40 leaseholders. Enfield has no shared equity scheme - if leaseholders want to buy one of the new shared ownership homes they will have to qualify for eligibility and pay rent on the unowned equity.</p>
