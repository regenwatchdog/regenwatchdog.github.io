I"Ø<p>306 homes are earmarked for demolition on Lambethâ€™s Cressingham Gardens estate at Brockwell Park.</p>

<p>In 2016, Lambeth Council <a href="https://moderngov.lambeth.gov.uk/documents/s80093/Cabinet%20Report%20-%20March%202016%20v8.pdf">took the decision</a> to demolish the estate based on fact that refurbishment estimates were Â£14,000 higher per dwelling than the rest of its estates and this represents â€˜poor value for moneyâ€™:</p>

<p>Lambeth also claims that the redevelopment of the estate will result in the provision of more â€˜affordableâ€™ housing to address the housing crisis. It plans to reprovide the existing council homes and provide an extra 27 at council rent plus a further 48 at â€˜no higher than LHA ratesâ€™:</p>

<p>The estate is one of <a href="/underthreat/lambeth/">four estates</a> earmarked for demolition in Lambethâ€™s estate renewal programme. It is not among those granted an <a href="/approved/ballotexemptions">exemption</a> from the Mayorâ€™s requirement to ballot residents on the demolition of their homes.</p>

<p>There is an active <a href="https://savecressingham.wordpress.com">campaign group</a> created by residents on the estate. In July 2019, they <a href="http://www.brixtonbuzz.com/2019/07/cressingham-gardens-residents-win-right-to-transfer/">had their application approved</a> for the Right To Transfer (RTT) ownership of the estate into a community-owned company outside of council control.</p>
