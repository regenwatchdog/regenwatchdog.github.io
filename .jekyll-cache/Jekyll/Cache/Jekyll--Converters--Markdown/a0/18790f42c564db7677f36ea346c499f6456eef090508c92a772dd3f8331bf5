<p>The Mayorâ€™s <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/better-homes-for-local-people-the-mayors-good-practice-guide-to-estate-regeneration.pdf">Estate Regeneration Policy</a> says that <i>â€œfull rights to return or remain for social tenants, and a fair deal for leaseholders and freeholders.â€</i></p>

<h2 id="tenants">Tenants</h2>
<p>In practice, few tenants choose to move or return to redeveloped estates and prefer to move for a number of reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The more precarious security of tenure being a housing association tenant.</li>
  <li>The higher rents - even when reprovided social housing is a social rents.</li>
  <li>Increased service charges and council tax.</li>
</ol>

<p>The obligation to rehouse tenants and homeowners uprooted by estate regeneration is enshrined within the general legal â€˜principle of equivalenceâ€™ which says that persons affected by compulsory purchase should be no worse off in financial terms after the compulsory acquisition and <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/8/section/233">section 233(paras 5 &amp; 7) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990</a>, which says that persons compulsorily removed from their homes for planning purposes must be offered <i>â€˜suitable accommodationâ€™</i> on the redeveloped land <i>â€˜on terms settled with due regard to the price at which any such land has been acquired from himâ€™.</i></p>
