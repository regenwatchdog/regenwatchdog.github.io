<p>It is also within the boundary of the <strong>Edgeware Road Housing Zone</strong>, one of <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/housing-and-land/increasing-housing-supply/housing-zones#acc-i-42741">30 special housing zones</a> designated by the Mayor to deliver accelerated housing development. The Edgeware Road zone is expected to deliver 1700 new homes.</p>

<p>The redevelopment of the estate has not been specifically included in the <a href="https://committees.westminster.gov.uk/documents/s24437/Church_Street_masterplan__boards.pdf">current masterplan</a> but this does envisage bringing such further sites forward within the next 15-20 years.</p>
