I"Í<p>The original estate was completed in 1977, providing approximately 2,700 homes. In 1999 the Aylesbury estate received Â£56m as part of Labourâ€™s New Deal for Communities (NDC) programme.Â 
The NDC finished in 2010 and theâ€¯Aylesbury Area Action Plan (AAAP) was formally adopted in 2010. The plan outlined the estateâ€™s regeneration, involving a phased demolition of all existing buildings and their rebuild, increasing density from the current 2,700 homes to 4,900.Â The first new homes were completed in 2012 and the Council appointed Notting Hill Housing Trust as its Development Partner. The further works will happen in four phases, leading to an incremental decant and demolition of the estate, with the overall regeneration estimated to be completed in 2036.

<p class="lead">Key themes discussed in the interviews:</p>
        <ul>
		<li>Residents have experienced long term interference and disruption to services due to building works from the regeneration.</li>
		<li>Leaseholders express concern that will not be adequately compensated for their homes, meaning they therefore will be unable to afford homes on the estate or in the area after regeneration.</li>
		<li>There is a sense that South London as an area is experiencing gentrification pressure and that the area is likely to change for a different demographic of residents.</li>
		<li>It was often expressed that foreign investment drives the changes and this creates resentment.</li>
		<li>There is a fear for the future and shared opinion that the Council is intentionally displacing residents.</li>
		<li>The loss of the Heygate Estate and the displacement of its residents is referenced often and likely adds to these fears.</li></ul>
