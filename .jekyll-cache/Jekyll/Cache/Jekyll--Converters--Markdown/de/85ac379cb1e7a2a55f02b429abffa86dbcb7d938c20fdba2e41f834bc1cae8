I"¥<p>306 homes are earmarked for demolition on Lambethâ€™s Cressingham Gardens estate at Brockwell Park.</p>

<p>Lambeth also claims that the redevelopment of the estate will result in the provision of more â€˜affordableâ€™ housing to address the housing crisis. It plans to reprovide the existing council homes and provide an extra 27 at council rent plus a further 48 at â€˜no higher than LHA ratesâ€™:</p>
