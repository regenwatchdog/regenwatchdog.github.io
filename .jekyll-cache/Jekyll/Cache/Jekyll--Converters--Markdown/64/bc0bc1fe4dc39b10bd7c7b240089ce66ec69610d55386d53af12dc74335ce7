I"ö<p>Circa 50 Council homes are set for demolition in Aspen House as part of Camdenâ€™s <a href="https://www.camden.gov.uk/maitland-park">regeneration of Maitland Park estate</a>.</p>

<p>Camden started decanting tenants from Aspen House in 2013 and a planning application was approved in February 2015. Delays meant that the last secure tenants were moved out in September 2019 and the remaining flats have been <a href="https://uk.vps-guardians.com/bookonline/locations-building.jsp?id=-7814773019304955797">occupied by property guardians</a>. In February 2020 it was <a href="http://camdennewjournal.com/article/mystery-of-fire-death-of-man-in-demolition-council-block">reported</a> that a man had died in a blaze in one of the flats.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://camdennewjournal.com/article/mystery-of-fire-death-of-man-in-demolition-council-block">Camden Journal article</a> also hears from former tenant Kristian Lawton, a former Aspen House tenant, who said: <em>â€œI was told I could move back when the new block is built â€“ that was in April 2017. I havenâ€™t heard anything since from the council and this is the first I have heard that the block is actually being demolished. We were promised that the new block would be finished within two years.â€</em></p>
