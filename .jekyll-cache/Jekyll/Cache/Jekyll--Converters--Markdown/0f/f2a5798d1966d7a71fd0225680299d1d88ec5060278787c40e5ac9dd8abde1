I"Ü<p>41 homes on Barkingâ€™s Thames View estate have been earmarked for demolition by Barking and Dagenham Council.</p>

<p>Barking and Dagenhamâ€™s <a href="https://modgov.lbbd.gov.uk/internet/documents/s87069/Estate%20Renewal%20Programme%20Report%20-%20App.%201%20Options%20Appraisal.pdf">options appraisal report</a> claims that the homes on this site require decent homes works (at Â£10k per dwelling) and they donâ€™t maximise their economic potential.</p>

<p>The scheme is being progressed by the Council in conjunction with its subsidiary affordable housing company <a href="https://www.lbbd.gov.uk/affordable-rents-reside-housing">Reside</a> which provides intermediate rented housing <em>â€œto people who are in employment, but canâ€™t afford to buy or rent privately and have limited access to social housingâ€</em></p>

<p>The Council says that tenants wanting to return to the redeveloped site will pay â€˜socialâ€™ rents and that the 5 current leaseholders will have the â€˜Right to Returnâ€™ to the redeveloped site. But its <a href="https://modgov.lbbd.gov.uk/Internet/documents/s131918/Estate%20Renewal%20Report.pdf">rehousing policy</a> provides little detail on how this works in practice - it offers an â€˜equity loanâ€™ scheme but it is discretionary and dependent upon the size of the gap between the value of leaseholdersâ€™ current homes and the new ones proposed to be built. (para 2.9)</p>
