I"€<p>40 Council homes are under threat of demolition on Westminsterâ€™s Cundy Street estate.</p>

<p>The estate is owned by the Duke of Westminster (Grosvenor estates) who proposes to demolish the 111 homes (40 of which council homes in Walden House) which Grosvenor leases to the council, and replaced by 93 â€œaffordableâ€ homes, 70 for full market price sale and 170 specialist â€œsenior livingâ€ accommodation units.</p>

<p>Grosvenor has launched a series of online â€˜webinarâ€™ consultation sessions and is planning to submit a planning application in late 2020. It is unclear whether Grosvenor is planning to apply for Mayoral funding which would trigger a ballot requirement.</p>

<p>There is an active campaign against the proposals with links provided below.</p>
