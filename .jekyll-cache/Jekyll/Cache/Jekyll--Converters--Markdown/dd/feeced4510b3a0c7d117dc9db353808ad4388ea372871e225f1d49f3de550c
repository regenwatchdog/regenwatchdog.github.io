I"ðF<p>The original estate was completed in 1977, providing 2,758 homes. In 1999 the Aylesbury estate received Â£56m as part of Labourâ€™s New Deal for Communities (NDC) programme.Â 
The NDC finished in 2010 and theâ€¯ Aylesbury Area Action Plan (AAAP) was formally adopted. The AAAP outlined the estateâ€™s regeneration, involving phased demolition of all existing buildings and new-build re-development, increasing density to 3,575 homes.Â The first new homes were completed in 2012 and the Council appointed Notting Hill Genesis Housing Association as its development partner. The further works will happen in four phases, leading to an incremental decant and demolition of the estate, with the overall regeneration estimated to be completed in 2036.</p>

<p>Notting Hill Genesisâ€™ <a href="http://planbuild.southwark.gov.uk/documents/?GetDocument=%7b%7b%7b!clWxEC35adJ29O7pMe62Bg%3d%3d!%7d%7d%7d">planning application</a> describes the replacement â€˜social housingâ€™ as a mix of â€˜target and affordable rentâ€™ and acknowledges that in any event there will be an overall net loss of 931 social rented homes.</p>

<p>In February 2015 a group of protesters <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/18/six-arrested-as-police-help-in-evictions-from-london-estate">occupied</a> the first development site in protest at the loss of council homes and residents <a href="/images/SNWolverton.pdf">disenfranchised</a> by the scheme.</p>

<p>In September 2016, after a <a href="http://35percent.org/2016-09-18-aylesbury-compulsory-purchase-order-rejected/">protracted public inquiry</a> the Secretary of State <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/16/government-blocks-controversial-plan-to-force-out-housing-estate-residents">rejected</a> Southwark Councilâ€™s application to remove remaining leaseholders with a compulsory purchase order on the grounds that rehousing offers to leaseholders wouldnâ€™t enable them to stay in the area. This subsequently led to a <a href="/images/SN19April2018.pdf">policy change</a> which improved the rehousing offer.</p>

        <p class="font-weight-light">In this short documentary film - The Aylesbury - directed by James Webber, Loretta Lees and estate residents are interviewed about the estate. The film begins with the building of the Aylesbury estate as part of the post-war slum clearances in South London, highlighting its use of the pre-fab method implemented by Laing Construction; it then compares the joy its new residents experienced on moving in with the more negative portrayals from the media, including its denigration by architect-planner Oscar Newman. The film continues by discussing the managed decline of the estate and the demolition and displacement its residents are currently experiencing. It underlines the story of a community that will soon disappear.</p>
	   <p class="font-weight-normal">The Director, James Webber, has an MA in Screen Documentary from Goldsmiths, University of London, he currently works for the London-based documentary film distributor Dogwoof.</p>

	  <p class="font-weight-light">Former Aylesbury resident</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p class="card-text">"The Aylesbury estate in South London was one of the best estates to live on before deliberate managed decline. It is one of the largest council estates in England and Europe. With its beautiful brutalist architectural construction, the properties are homely, spacious, bright and airy with lots of outside space, greenery and communal space for bringing a community together. These types of homes would be excellent in a pandemic lockdown situation - for good health and well-being. Council homes and estates are great to establish a community and long term security. Unfortunately my community was taken away from me when I was forced to live alone for almost 5 years in a high rise council block of 171 empty flats, as I fought for my home and community. I was the only one living there in my two bedroom flat because the Council wanted to take my 31 year home and savings in the name of regeneration. Where is the justice in that? No homes, no community! Bring back council homes with community spirit. Donâ€™t isolate and segregate in the name of profit. Having a secure home is the core of belonging and living. Community, community! Fight to save your home and community!"</p>

<p class="lead">Key themes discussed in the interviews:</p>
        <ul>
		<li>Residents have experienced long term interference and disruption (including to services) due to building works from the regeneration.</li>
		<li>Leaseholder often expressed concern that they will not be adequately compensated for their homes, meaning they will be unable to afford homes on the redeveloped site or in the area after regeneration.</li>
		<li>The residents sense that South London as an area is experiencing gentrification pressure and that the area is likely to change to accommodate a different demographic of residents.</li>
		<li>It was often expressed that financial investment is driving the changes and this creates resentment.</li>
		<li>There is a fear for the future and residents shared an opinion that the Council is intentionally displacing residents.</li>
		<li>The symbolic loss of the adjacent Heygate Estate and the displacement of its residents is referenced often and likely adds to these fears.</li></ul>
