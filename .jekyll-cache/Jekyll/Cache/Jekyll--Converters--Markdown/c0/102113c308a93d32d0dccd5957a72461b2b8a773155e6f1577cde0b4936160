<p>Often when appraisals are undertaken to evaluate estate redevelopment, a number of crucial factors are not taken into account:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The financial cost of decanting the estate including buy-out costs of leaseholders.</li>
  <li>The loss of rental income for the Council both in the short term and long term.</li>
  <li>The social cost of decants on the housing waiting list and <a href="/images/temporaryspend.pdf">increased temporary accommodation costs</a>.</li>
  <li>The environmental cost of discarding thousands of tonnes of embodied carbon and generating thousands of tonnes of new uneccessary carbon emissions in the new-build construction.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="/images/genslerheygate.pdf">This case study</a> by Gensler architects shows how the refurbishment of the Heygate estate could have saved 40,000 tonnes of carbon emissions:</p>

<p>The <a href="/images/sixacres.pdf">refurbishment of the Six Acres estate</a> in Islington serves as an example of what can be achieved. The estate is build with the same system as both the Heygate and Aylesbury estates.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.engineering.ucl.ac.uk/engineering-exchange/files/2014/10/Report-Refurbishment-Demolition-Social-Housing.pdf">further report</a> by University College London (UCL Engineeering Exchange) says that.. They have also published <a href="https://londontenants.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Fact-Sheet-Health-and-Wellbeing-Social-Housing.pdf">this factsheet</a> explaining the impacts of refurbishment vs demolition on wellbeing.</p>

<p>The Architects Journal is running a campaign to show how refurbishment is almost always better than redevelopment using a number of case studies as examples: <a href="https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/retrofirst">https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/retrofirst</a></p>

<p>Regeneration is often preceeded (and subsequently justified) by a period of disinvestment.</p>
