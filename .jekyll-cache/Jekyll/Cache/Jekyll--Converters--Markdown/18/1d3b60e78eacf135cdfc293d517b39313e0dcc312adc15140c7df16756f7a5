                "I was told in a letter that they were going to bring them down and they were going to build new homes for us to move into. This is what I was led to believe, but I didnâ€™t know that those new ones are for sale, and for those who can afford to put down private rent, which I canâ€™t. So, Iâ€™m losing my home, where Iâ€™ve just had a new kitchen put in and new bathroom, and I donâ€™t know where Iâ€™m going to end up, and Iâ€™m worried because my husbandâ€™s [age] next year, and we donâ€™t know. The only thing theyâ€™ve offered us is sheltered, like a sheltered flat for older people, but they are tiny, and Iâ€™ve got a lot of things and I donâ€™t want to go into sheltered accommodation. Thatâ€™s my worry, my right."

                "It was a rumour, because I was calling it, â€œWhy are the blocks not down?â€ Thereâ€™s no central heating. Iâ€™ve lived 15 years with no central heating, no double glazing. So, the winters are ridiculous. Itâ€™s just disgusting, and they didnâ€™t care. They donâ€™t care. As I said, the redevelopment is not for us, itâ€™s not for poor people, itâ€™s for people that are working, although Iâ€™m working, but itâ€™s just for a whole different set of people."

              <p>"there was a lot of dissatisfaction from the families we know in our estate. They were saying, â€˜Well, what else can we do?â€™ Weâ€™ve raised our awareness and problems in public hearing meetings by the Council, but the shift in the Council side isnâ€™t much. The maximum is 10% or we just take what they give us. So, there isnâ€™t much room to accommodate, and one of my neighbours heâ€™s thinking about moving with his brothers that live in Birmingham, and this would be like good money to invest in a good-sized house for him. Another neighbours has moved out to Leicester. So, he found really good work there, but, again the shift that people are saying, â€˜Well, what else can we do?'."</p>
