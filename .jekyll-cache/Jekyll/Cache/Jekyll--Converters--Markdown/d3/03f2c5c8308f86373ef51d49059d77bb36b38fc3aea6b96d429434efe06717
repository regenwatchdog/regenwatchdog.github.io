<p>Regeneration plans for the High Road West scheme were approved by Haringey Councilâ€™s cabinet in December 2014, which includes the demolition of the Love Lane estate. Haringeyâ€¯ Councilâ€¯served an Initial Demolition Notice to residents on the estate in February 2015 and the Council began rehousing secure council tenants and moving in temporary tenants â€“ there are now 180 temporary tenants on the estate (temporary tenants can be removed quickly in the run up to demolition).</p>

<p>Haringey Councilâ€™s <a href="https://tottenham.london/HighRoadWest">dedicated website</a> provides further details. A ballot of residents is due to be held in Autumn 2020.</p>

<p>In April 2020, Love Lane estate residents <a href="https://www.enfieldindependent.co.uk/news/18397780.residents-group-tottenham-estate-slams-housing-offer/">slammed the Council</a> for its rehousing offer not being clear about the proposed rent levels in the replacement â€˜socialâ€™ housing.</p>
