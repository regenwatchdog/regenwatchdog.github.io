I"€<p>Circa 100 homes remain earmarked for demolition on Barking and Dagenhamâ€™s Leys estate.</p>

<p>The Leys Estate is located in Dagenham, just south of Rainham Road close to its junction with Ballards Road. The estate is surrounded by parkland and comprises two neighbourhoods - Birdbrook Close (proposed phase 1); and, Wellington Drive (proposed phase 2). The estate is approximately half a mile south of Dagenham East Underground station.</p>

<p>Phase one of the scheme is nearing completion and involved demolition of around 100 of the estates 215 homes in 2015. Phase 2 of the scheme is still fully occupied and the formal decant process hasnâ€™t yet started.</p>

<p>The overall redevelopment will provide 158 new homes - all of which at affordable rent (up to 80% market rent) and is being progressed by the Councilâ€™s subsidiary affordable housing company <a href="https://www.lbbd.gov.uk/affordable-rents-reside-housing">Reside</a> which provides intermediate rented housing <em>â€œto people who are in employment, but canâ€™t afford to buy or rent privately and have limited access to social housingâ€</em></p>

<p>The Council says that tenants wanting to return to the redeveloped site will pay â€˜socialâ€™ rents and that current leaseholders will have the â€˜Right to Returnâ€™ to the redeveloped estate. But its <a href="https://modgov.lbbd.gov.uk/Internet/documents/s131918/Estate%20Renewal%20Report.pdf">rehousing policy</a> provides little detail on how this works in practice - it offers an â€˜equity loanâ€™ scheme but it is discretionary and dependent upon the size of the gap between the value of leaseholdersâ€™ current homes and the new ones proposed to be built.
