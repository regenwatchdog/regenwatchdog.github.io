I"â<p>The estate was built in the early 60â€™sÂ and has 297Â homes. Regeneration plans for the High Road West scheme were approved by Haringey Councilâ€™s Cabinet in December 2014, this includes the demolition of the Love Lane estate. Haringeyâ€¯Councilâ€¯served an Initial Demolition Notice to residents on the estate in February 2015 and the Council began rehousing secure council tenants and moving in temporary tenants â€“ there are now 180 temporary tenants on the estate. A residentâ€™s ballot is due to take place on the estate.</p>

<p class="lead">Key themes discussed in the interviews:</p>        

<ul>
		<li>Love Lane residents express a lack of clear information about the regeneration of their estate, despite some council tenants being moved out several years back and having temporary tenants moved into these properties.</li>
		<li>Those with temporary tenancies feel especially disregarded and vulnerable to displacement.</li>
		<li>Long term residents on the Love Lane estate expressed a sense of intentional degeneration of the estate.</li>
		<li>There is a feeling that the area is changing for a different more middle-class demographic.</li>
		<li>Long term housing affordability in the Tottenham area is a shared concern.</li>
		<li>There is a common mistrust towards Haringey Council and its leadership; often referenced is the failed Haringey Development Vehicle (HDV) scheme, the threat of displacement to the Latin Village, and the dominance of the Tottenham Hotspurs Stadium on the area.</li></ul>

Unless you get a clear message, you cannot plan for your future, you donâ€™t understand whatâ€™s going to happen.
