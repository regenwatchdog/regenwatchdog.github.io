## STEP 1: Make your demands clear from the outset

Before Compulsory Purchase Orders are initiated, the landlord will have needed to set out what its offer is to leaseholders - either in a 'Landlord Offer' document which is part of the ballot process, or in an approved policy document if the landlord is a local authority.

You will have the opportunity to challenge and influence the details of the landlord offer prior to and throughout the CPO process. It will be the main consideration when it comes to challenging a CPO so it is important that you set out clearly the terms of the rehousing package you want to be offered.

The Government's [Estate Regeneration National Guidance](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/575578/Estate_Regeneration_National_Strategy_-_Resident_Engagement_and_Protection.pdf) documents proposes a 'Home Swap' option (see page 9) where leaseholders are offered full ownership of a new home on the redeveloped estate and any difference in value is disregarded, provided that the leaseholder doesn't sell up before 7 years after moving in.

This is the most equitable of options available for leaseholders as they are able to remain as part of the community within the redeveloped estate while not being disadvantaged i.e. they are put back in a position of owning 100% of their home not just part of it.

At least two housing associations in London offer this home swap model - Poplar HARCA in Tower Hamlets (see more info [here](https://www.estatewatch.london/images/teviotoffer.pdf)) and Clarion housing association (see more info [here](circle housing association)).   

Most other landlords will offer what is usually called a 'shared equity' or 'equity loan' scheme for leaseholders. But these schemes can differ from one another significantly and there are a number of problems with them. 

Some of them require leaseholders to sink their personal savings into the scheme or take out a mortgage. Some have high minimum thresholds requiring the leaseholder to be able to afford at least 50% or sometimes as much as 80% equity. This has the effect of requiring leaseholders to use personal savings or take out a mortgage. Some schemes don't allow the equity share to be passed on to descendants and some require the leaseholder to pay the landlord's share of any major works charges. A further complication is that the leaseholder is obliged to accept the landlord's valuation of their current home and that of the replacement home. 

So it is important to read the small print and ensure that any shared equity scheme includes the following guarantees as a minimum:

1. The required minimum equity share is not higher than 25%.
2. The leaseholder is not means tested or obliged to sink savings or re-mortgage.
3. The equity share agreement can be inherited by a spouse or descendant.
4. Any future Major Works charges are apportioned to the percentage share owned.
5. The Council/Landlord instructs the District Valuer Service to conduct its valuations and agrees to pay leaseholders to instruct an independent surveyor to conduction their own valuations of their existing homes and the replacement home offered under shared equity.
6. Any disagreement about the valuation of the existing homes or the proposed replacements is referred to a suitably qualified mediation service at the full cost of the Council/Landlord, while leaseholders reserve their statutory right to challenge the valuation at Tribunal should the mediation be unsuccessful.

Ultimately, the 'home-swap' option avoids all of these complications because it is a simple swap - a replacement home for the one that is being demolished.

The government's [Compulsory Purchase Code](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/571453/booklet4.pdf) sets out an overriding principle - the principle of equivalence:

You should use this to lobby your landlord and argue that you own 100% of your home now and that you should be entitled to a 'home swap' which will allow you to own 100% of a new home on the estate.
