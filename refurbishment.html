		           <h1>Making the case for refurbishment</h1>
			         <p class="lead text-muted" align="left">
Research has shown that refurbishment of council estates is the best option when environmental and social factors are properly taken into account. Refurbishment can deliver significant improvements in energy, environmental and health performance, which can lead to costs savings and improved living standards for residents. It can have lower overall lifetime costs than redevelopment and can cause less disruption to communities.
</br></br>
Just Space and LTF commissioned the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/engineering-exchange/">Engineering Exchange at UCL</a> to review the technical evidence for demolition vs refurbishment of social housing. They produced a series of factsheets, videos and a peer-reviewed report, which you can explore below. </p>

        <p class="lead">The construction industry produces no less than 35-40 per cent of the UKâ€™s total carbon emissions and 35 per cent of materials desposited as waste. Refurbishment avoids this waste and conserves the emissions embodied in the construction materials, the building process, as well as emissions produced from demolition. </p>

        <p class="lead">Option appraisals often fail to take a number of crucial factors into account:
	<ul>
		<li>The financial cost of decanting the estate including buy-out costs of leaseholders.</li>
		<li>The loss of rental income for the Council both in the short term and long term.</li>
	        <li>Increased temporary accommodation costs as a result of decanting tenants into existing stock.</li>
	</ul>
	Our <a href="/images/residentscharter_template.docx">template Residents' Charter</a> sets out detailed requirements ensuring that theseconsiderations as well as environmental factors are taken into account from the outset.
